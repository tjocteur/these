For a large class of processes, in which saturation prevents unlimited growth, statistical properties of the surviving sample attain time-independent limiting values. We may then define a quasi-stationary probability distribution as one in which the ratios pn(t)/pm(t) (for any pair of non-absorbing states n and m) are time-independent. This is not a true stationary distribution, since the overall normalization decays as probability flows irreversibly to the absorbing state. We construct quasi-stationary solutions for the contact process on a complete graph, the Malthus--Verhulst process, Schl{\"o}gl's second model and the voter model on a complete graph. We also construct the master equation and quasi-stationary state in a two-site approximation for the contact process and for a pair of competing Malthus--Verhulst processes.},

We first investigate the physical origin of universality in these systems, before comparing RG methods to other available analytic techniques, including exact solutions and Smoluchowski-type approximations. Starting from the microscopic reaction--diffusion master equation, we then pedagogically detail the mapping to a field theory for the single-species reaction kA {$\rightarrow$} {$\ell$}A({$\ell$} {$<$} k). We employ this particularly simple but non-trivial system to introduce the field-theoretic RG tools, including the diagrammatic perturbation expansion, renormalization and Callan--Symanzik RG flow equation. We demonstrate how these techniques permit the calculation of universal quantities such as density decay exponents and amplitudes via perturbative {$\epsilon$} = dc - d expansions with respect to the upper critical dimension dc. With these basics established, we then provide an overview of more sophisticated applications to multiple species reactions, disorder effects, L{\'e}vy flights, persistence problems and the influence of spatial boundaries. We also analyse field-theoretic approaches to non-equilibrium phase transitions separating active from absorbing states. We focus particularly on the generic directed percolation universality class, as well as on the most prominent exception to this class: even-offspring branching and annihilating random walks. Finally, we summarize the state of the field and present our perspective on outstanding problems for the future.},

We present a simple model for this phenomenon, based on which we argue that this transition lies in the universality class of the conserved directed percolation models. This leads to predictions for the scaling behavior of a large number of experimental observables. Non-Brownian suspensions under oscillatory shear may thus constitute the first experimental realization of an inactive-active phase transition which is not in the universality class of conventional directed percolation.},

  abstract = {Driven by physical questions pertaining to quantifying particle dynamics, microscopy can now resolve complex systems at the single-particle level, from cellular organisms to individual ions. Yet, available analysis techniques face challenges reconstructing trajectories in dense and heterogeneous systems where accurately labeling particles is difficult. Furthermore, the inescapable finite field of view of experiments hinders the measurement of collective effects. Inspired by Smoluchowski, we introduce a broadly applicable analysis technique that probes dynamics of interacting particle suspensions based on a remarkably simple principle: counting particles in finite observation boxes. Using colloidal experiments, advanced simulations, and theory, we first demonstrate that statistical properties of fluctuating counts can be used to determine self-diffusion coefficients, so alleviating the hurdles associated with trajectory reconstruction. We also provide a recipe for practically extracting the diffusion coefficient from experimental data at variable particle densities, which is sensitive to steric and hydrodynamic interactions. Remarkably, by increasing the observation box size, counting naturally enables the study of collective dynamics in dense suspensions. Using our novel analysis of particle counts, we uncover a surprising enhancement of collective behavior due to hydrodynamics as well as a new length scale which can be connected with hyperuniform structure. Our counting framework, the ``countoscope,'' thus enables efficient measurements of self and collective dynamics in dense suspensions and opens the way to quantifying dynamics and identifying novel physical mechanisms in diverse complex systems where single particles can be resolved.},

Here, we demonstrate an archetypal Loschmidt-echo experiment involving thousands of droplets that interact in a reversible fashion via a viscous fluid. First, we show that periodically driven microfluidic emulsions self-organize and geometrically protect their macroscopic reversibility. Self-organization is not merely dynamical: it has a clear structural signature. Second, we show that, above a maximal shaking amplitude, structural order and reversibility are lost simultaneously through a first-order non-equilibrium phase transition. We account for this discontinuous transition in terms of a memory-loss process. Finally, we suggest potential applications of microfluidic echo as a robust tool to tailor colloidal self-assembly at large scales.},

  abstract = {Close to the yielding transition, amorphous solids exhibit a jerky dynamics characterized by plastic avalanches. The statistics of these avalanches have been measured experimentally and numerically using a variety of different triggering protocols, assuming that all of them were equivalent for this purpose. In particular, two main classes of protocols have been studied, deformation under controlled strain or under controlled stress. In this work, we investigate different protocols to generate plasticity avalanches and conduct two-dimensional simulations of an elastoplastic model to examine the protocol dependence of avalanche statistics in yield-stress fluids. We demonstrate that when stress is controlled, the value and even the existence of the exponent governing the probability distribution function of avalanche sizes strongly depend on the protocol chosen to initiate avalanches. This confirms in finite dimension a scenario presented in a previous mean-field analysis. We identify a consistent stress-controlled protocol whose associated avalanches differ from the quasi-static ones in their fractal dimension and dynamical exponent. Remarkably, this protocol also seems to satisfy the scaling relations among exponents previously proposed. Our results underscore the necessity for a cautious interpretation of avalanche universality within elastoplastic models, and more generally within systems where several control parameters exist.},

The model combines a full (tensorial) description of the elastic interactions in the system and the possibility of structural reaccommodations that are responsible for the plastic behavior. The possible structural reaccommodations are encoded in the form of a ``plastic disorder'' potential, which is chosen independently at each position of the sample to account for local heterogeneities. We observe that the stress must exceed a critical value {$\sigmac$} in order for the system to yield. In addition, when the system yields a flow curve (relating stress {$\sigma$} and strain rate{\. }{$\gamma$}) of the form{\. }{$\gamma\sim$}({$\sigma-\sigmac$}){$B$} is obtained. Remarkably, we observe the value of {$B$} to depend on some details of the plastic disorder potential. For smooth potentials a value of {$B\simeq$}2.0 is obtained, whereas for potentials obtained as a concatenation of smooth pieces a value {$B\simeq$}1.5 is observed in the simulations. This indicates a dependence of critical behavior on details of the plastic behavior. In addition, by integrating out nonessential, harmonic degrees of freedom, we derive a simplified scalar version of the model that represents a collection of interacting Prandtl-Tomlinson particles. A mean-field treatment of this interaction reproduces the difference of {$B$} exponents for the two classes of plastic disorder potentials and provides values of {$B$} that compare favorably with those found in the full simulations.},

However, we find that these flow laws change in the regime of intermittent flow, where collective events no longer overlap and serrated flow becomes pronounced. In this regime, we identify a thermal activation stress scale, xa(T,), that wholly captures the effect of driving rate and temperature T on average flow stress, stress drop (avalanche) size and correlation lengths. Different rheological regimes are summarized in a dynamic phase diagram for the amorphous yielding transition. Theoretical predictions call for a need to re-examine the rheology of very slowly sheared amorphous matter much below the glass transition.},

We discuss the non-Gibbsian character of the stationary solution for the case of the Hookean force, i.e., the deviation from Boltzmann equilibrium for long times. The possible connection to Tsallis's q statistics is studied.},

  abstract = {A detailed study of the mean-field solution of Langevin equations with multiplicative noise is presented. Three different regimes depending on noise intensity (weak, intermediate, and strong noise) are identified by performing a self-consistent calculation on a fully connected lattice. The most interesting, strong-noise, regime is shown to be intrinsically unstable with respect to the inclusion of fluctuations, as a Ginzburg criterion shows. On the other hand, the self-consistent approach is shown to be valid only in the thermodynamic limit, while for finite systems the critical behavior is found to be different. In this last case, the self-consistent field itself is broadly distributed rather than taking a well defined mean value; its fluctuations, described by an effective zero-dimensional multiplicative noise equation, govern the critical properties. These findings are obtained analytically for a fully connected graph, and verified numerically both on fully connected graphs and on random regular networks. The results presented here shed some doubt on what is the validity and meaning of a standard mean-field approach in systems with multiplicative noise in finite dimensions, where each site does not see an infinite number of neighbors, but a finite one. The implications of all this on the existence of a finite upper critical dimension for multiplicative noise and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang problems are briefly discussed.},

Already discussed by Leonardo da Vinci and Edm{\'e} Mariotte several centuries ago, size effects on strength remain of crucial importance in modern engineering for the elaboration of safety regulations in structural design or the extrapolation of laboratory results to geophysical field scales. Under tensile loading, statistical size effects are traditionally modeled with a weakest-link approach. One of its prominent results is a prediction of vanishing strength at large scales that can be quantified in the framework of extreme value statistics. Despite a frequent use outside its range of validity, this approach remains the dominant tool in the field of statistical size effects. Here we focus on compressive failure, which concerns a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical situations. We show on historical and recent experimental data that weakest-link predictions are not obeyed. In particular, the mechanical strength saturates at a nonzero value toward large scales. Accounting explicitly for the elastic interactions between defects during the damage process, we build a formal analogy of compressive failure with the depinning transition of an elastic manifold. This critical transition interpretation naturally entails finite-size scaling laws for the mean strength and its associated variability. Theoretical predictions are in remarkable agreement with measurements reported for various materials such as rocks, ice, coal, or concrete. This formalism, which can also be extended to the flowing instability of granular media under multiaxial compression, has important practical consequences for future design rules.},

  abstract = {In a forest fire model with immune trees (FFMIT) recently proposed by Drossel and Schwabl (Physica A 199 (1993) 183), the sites of the lattice are either empty, a tree or a burning tree, and at each time step the system is updated in parallel according to the following rules: (i) A burning tree becomes an empty site, (ii) trees grow with probability p from empty sites, and (iii) a green tree becomes a burning tree with probability (1-g) if at least one next neighbor is burning. Fixing an arbitrary grow probability (p) and starting with a small immunity (g), increments of g causes the fire density of the steady state to decrease until the fire becomes irreversibly extinguished at a certain critical point of coordinates \{pc, gc\}. The set of critical points defines a critical curve gc (p) which, in the L = {$\infty$} limit, divides the \{p, g\}-plane in two regions: a steady state with fire fronts for g {$<$} gc(p) and an unique absorbing state with all sites occupied by green trees for g {$\geq$} gc(p). It is shown, by means of an epidemic spreading analysis that the continuous irreversible phase transition between the stationary regime and the absorbing state belongs to the same universality class as Reggeon field theory. It is found that within the absorbing state time correlations are short-ranged and that the fire density decrease exponentially. Within the stationary regime the irreversible transition is studied in terms of the finite-size scaling theory that was already developed to describe reversible transitions. The results reported in this work show that problems emerging from (apparently) unrelated branches of science such as particle physics, catalysis, directed percolation, and epidemic spreading can be understood by means of a unified description.},

Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabu\-lated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

We perform numerical simulations of dense suspensions of rigid non-Brownian spherical particles at volume fractions (\${\textbackslash}phi\$) between 0.40 and 0.55 subject to this new RS protocol and compare to the classical OS protocol. We find that the suspension viscosity displays a similar non-monotonic response as the strain amplitude (\${\textbackslash}gamma\_0\$) is increased: a minimum viscosity is found at an intermediate, volume-fraction dependent strain amplitude. However, the suspension dynamics is different in the new protocol. Unlike the OS protocol, suspensions under RS do not show self-adsorbing states at any \${\textbackslash}gamma\_0\$ and do not undergo the reversible-irreversible transition: the stroboscropic particle dynamics are always diffusive, which we attribute to the fact that the RS protocol is irreversible. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce a reversible-RS (RRS) protocol, a combination of RS and OS, where we rotate the shear direction (as in RS) until it is instantaneously reversed (as in OS), and find the resulting rheology and dynamics to be closer to OS. Detailed microstructure analysis shows that both the OS and RRS protocols result in a contact-free, isotropic to an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure at the dynamically reversible-to-irreversible transition. The RS protocol does not render such a transition, and the dynamics remain diffusive with an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure for all strain amplitudes.},

We illustrate this in sandpiles, where SOC is a consequence of slow driving in a system exhibiting an absorbing-state phase transition with a conserved density. Other paths to SOC, in driven interfaces, the Bak-Sneppen model, and self- organized directed percolation, are also examined.

For stronger heterogeneities, we first discuss the behavior of the contact line in the presence of a single, localized defect, and show that there may exist two stable positions for the line, obtained by a simple graphic construction. Hysteresis shows up when the strength of the defect is above a certain threshold. Extending this to a dilute system of defects, we obtain formulas for the ``advancing'' and ``receding'' contact angles {\texttheta}a, {\texttheta}r, in terms of the distribution of defect strength and defect sharpness. These formulas might be tested by controlled contamination of a solid surface.}

The roughening exponent in the critical region is shown to be independent of the type of disorder, in contrast to the equilibrium static behavior where there are two different universality classes corresponding to random-bond and random-field disorder. This critical dynamic roughening exponent is argued to be equal to its equilibrium static random-field value: {$\zetac$}={$\varepsilon$}/3 to all orders in {$\varepsilon$} in 5-{$\varepsilon$} dimensions. All other critical exponents are obtained in terms of z, the dynamic exponent, which is calculated to O({$\varepsilon$}) to be z=2-2{$\varepsilon$}/9+O({$\varepsilon$}2). The results agree fairly well with recent numerical simulations. For random-field disorder, the same results have been obtained earlier by Nattermann et al. [J. Phys.

The results above threshold are used, together with scaling laws, to yield conjectures on the critical behavior as threshold is approached from below.

  abstract = {The concept of self-organized criticality was introduced to explain the behaviour of the sandpile model. In this model, particles are randomly dropped onto a square grid of boxes. When a box accumulates four particles they are redistributed to the four adjacent boxes or lost off the edge of the grid. Redistributions can lead to further instabilities with the possibility of more particles being lost from the grid, contributing to the size of each avalanche. These model 'avalanches' satisfied a power-law frequency-area distribution with a slope near unity. Other cellular-automata models, including the slider-block and forest-fire models, are also said to exhibit self-organized critical behaviour. It has been argued that earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, and species extinctions are examples of self-organized criticality in nature. In addition, wars and stock market crashes have been associated with this behaviour. The forest-fire model is particularly interesting in terms of its relation to the critical-point behaviour of the site-percolation model. In the basic forest-fire model, trees are randomly planted on a grid of points. Periodically in time, sparks are randomly dropped on the grid. If a spark drops on a tree, that tree and adjacent trees burn in a model fire. The fires are the `avalanches' and they are found to satisfy power-law frequency-area distributions with slopes near unity. This forest-fire model is closely related to the site-percolation model, that exhibits critical behaviour. In the forest-fire model there is an inverse cascade of trees from small clusters to large clusters, trees are lost primarily from model fires that destroy the largest clusters. This quasi steady-state cascade gives a power-law frequency-area distribution for both clusters of trees and smaller fires. The site-percolation model is equivalent to the forest-fire model without fires. In this case there is a transient cascade of trees from small to large clusters and a power-law distribution is found only at a critical density of trees.},

A simple mean field theory and a ``toy'' model of ``avalanche'' processes are analyzed and used to motivate the general scaling picture found in recent renormalization group studies. The general ideas and results are then applied to various systems: sliding charge density waves, critical current behavior of vortices in superconductors, dynamics of cracks, and simple models of a geological fault.

Away from this line, an additional memory term arises in the interface dynamics; we argue that this does not change the universality class.

We find that shear transformation zones exist and are active in both sheared and quiescent colloidal glasses, revealed by a distinctive fourfold signature in spatial autocorrelations of the local shear strain. With increasing shear, the population of local shear transformations develops more quickly than in a quiescent glass and many of these transformations are irreversible. When the macroscopic strain is reversed, we observe partial elastic recovery, followed by plastic deformation of the opposite sign, required to compensate for the irreversibly transformed regions. The average diameter of the shear transformation zones in both strained and quiescent glasses is slightly more than two particle diameters.},

The athermal quasistatic trajectories are shown to separate into smooth, reversible elastic branches which are intermittently broken by discrete catastrophic plastic events. The onset of a typical plastic event is studied with precision, and it is shown that the mode of the system which is responsible for the loss of stability has structure in real space which is consistent with a quadrupolar source acting on an elastic matrix. The plastic events themselves are shown to be composed of localized shear transformations which organize into lines of slip which span the length of the simulation cell, and a mechanism for the organization is discussed. Although within a single event there are strong spatial correlations in the deformation, we find little correlation from one event to the next, and these transient lines of slip are not to be confounded with the persistent regions of localized shear---so-called ``shear bands''---found in related studies. The slip lines give rise to particular scalings with system length of various measures of event size. Strikingly, data obtained using three differing interaction potentials can be brought into quantitative agreement after a simple rescaling, emphasizing the insensitivity of the emergent plastic behavior in these disordered systems to the precise details of the underlying interactions. The results should be relevant to understanding plastic deformation in systems such as metallic glasses well below their glass temperature, soft glassy systems (such as dense emulsions), or compressed granular materials.},

  abstract = {Soft glassy materials far from their glass transition (low temperature, high density) exhibit divergent relaxation timescales and behave essentially as solids in absence of driving or biological activity.In this thesis, we investigate the dynamics, rheology and large scale organization of various types of (athermal) soft amorphous materials resulting either from an externally imposed driving (shear or vibration), from a local activity, or both.The main question behind the different projects constituting this thesis is: how do distinct sources of mechanical noise affect the fluidization and large scale organization of soft amorphous materials and how to account for it in coarse-grained descriptions?To this aim, we use a multi-scale modeling approach, from microscopic simulations to continuum modeling, with a main focus on mesoscale elasto-plastic models.The first topic of this thesis concerns shear localization in the flow of soft amorphous materials. We first consider the case of inertial dynamics at the microscopic scale as a rate-weakening mechanisms and show, using a continuum model, that permanent shear bands observed in particle-based simulations can be explained in terms of softening due to kinetic heating of the system under shear, with a shear rate dependent kinetic temperature.In a second part, we study how permanent shear bands are affected by an external (rate-independent) source of noise leading to the random activation of plastic rearrangements.We show, using a mesoscale elasto-plastic model with two different models of noise, that an increasing external noise leads to vanishing shear bands, and that the transition from heterogeneous to homogeneous flow can be interpreted as a nonequilibrium critical point. Our findings suggest that the critical exponents associated with this transition do not depend on the details of the activation dynamics for the noise, and are also consistent with recent experimental results on vibrated granular media.Fluidization by a rate-independent noise is an ubiquitous phenomenon, observed not only in vibrated granular media, but also in active or biological systems, where the noise if of active origin.In a third part, we study how active sources of noise resulting from the active deformation of particles can induce a fluidization of the system.Using inputs from microscopic simulations, we build a tensorial mesoscale elasto-plastic model for the dynamics of actively deforming particles.We show that this model reproduces the discontinuous fluidization transition observed in particle-based simulations and shares analogy with inert amorphous systems driven with an oscillatory shear protocol.In a last part, motivated by experiments in the lab, we consider a vertex-based model to study oscillations of the migration velocity of cells in confined epithelial tissues. We find that a feedback mechanism between the cell self-propulsion direction and velocity is required to observe oscillations, and that the type of oscillation observed depends upon the confinement length as reported in experiments.},

Based on this mechanism, we have explained how polycrystalline cubic diamond is converted from hexagonal graphite and demonstrated that the initial interlayer distance of compressed hexagonal graphite play a key role to determine the grain size of cubic diamond. These results can broaden our understanding of the high pressure graphite-to-diamond phase transition.},

Advocates of the true yield stress picture have demonstrated that the effective viscosity increases very rapidly as the stress is decreased towards the yield stress. Opponents have shown that this viscosity increase levels off, and that the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid of very high viscosity below the yield stress. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally (on four different materials, using three different rheometers, five different geometries, and two different measurement methods) that the low-stress Newtonian viscosity is an artifact that arises in non--steady-state experiments. For measurements as long as 104 seconds we find that the value of the ``Newtonian viscosity'' increases indefinitely. This proves that the yield stress exists and marks a sharp transition between flowing states and states where the steady-state viscosity is infinite ---a solid!},

  abstract = {The shear-induced self-diffusion and rheology of concentrated suspensions of noncolloidal hard spheres have been studied experimentally. The combined results provide an interesting physical picture. The projection of the trajectories of individual particles on the vorticity (z)--velocity (x) plane were determined through particle tracking. The particle trajectories turned out to be very useful for gaining qualitative insight into the microscopic particle motion. However, the technique is less suitable to obtain quantitative information. For a quantitative analysis of the particle displacements we measured the evolution of the ensemble averaged displacements as a function of time. The statistical analysis revealed two diffusion regimes, where {\textlangle}{$\Delta$}z{$\Delta$}z{\textrangle}{$\sim$}{\.undefined}{$\Delta$}t. For large strain values ({\.undefined}{$\Delta$}t\&gt;1) long-time self-diffusion was observed. The associated diffusion coefficient {\^D}{$\infty$} is in excellent agreement with literature data on shear-induced self-diffusion. On very short times ({\.undefined}{$\Delta$}t{$\ll$}1) a novel diffusive regime was discovered, characterized by a diffusion coefficient {\^D}0, which is significantly smaller than {\^D}{$\infty$} and grows monotonically with {$\varphi$}. {\^D}0 is detected on time scales on which the particle configuration is not changed significantly and thus it must represent the fluctuating motion of particles in the ``cage'' formed by their nearest neighbors. Finally, the rheology was studied with steady shear and oscillatory rheometry. The dynamic measurements in a controlled stress rheometer revealed that the viscoelastic response of the suspension is determined mainly by the amplitude of deformation. At small strain amplitudes {$\gamma$}0\&lt;1, the response is linear and a dynamic viscosity {$\eta\prime$} is found, which is in excellent agreement with the high frequency limit {$\eta\infty\prime$} as reported in literature for colloidal hard sphere suspensions. Around {$\gamma$}0=1 the ``cage'' around a particle is deformed and a shear-induced microstructure is built. This leads to O(a) displacements of the particles and the viscoelastic response becomes strongly nonharmonic. Although the effect persists at large amplitudes, it becomes relatively small for {$\gamma$}0{$\gg$}1. The microstructure is rearranged immediately after flow reversal and remains unchanged for the larger part of the period of oscillation. As a result a pseudolinear viscoelastic regime is found with a viscosity close to steady shear viscosity. Experiments show a correlation between the time scales controlling the {\^D}0/{\^D}{$\infty$} diffusive behavior and the ones controlling the shear-induced changes in particle configuration as probed by the rheological measurements.}

Here, we show that the correlation functions of the velocity field along the front allow us to extract the critical exponents of the transition and to identify the universality class of the system. We employ these correlations to characterize the universal behavior of the transition in simulations and in an experiment of crack propagation.

  abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a potentially unstable component of the Earth system and may exhibit a critical transition under ongoing global warming. Mass reductions of the GrIS have substantial impacts on global sea level and the speed of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, due to the additional freshwater caused by increased meltwater runoff into the northern Atlantic. The stability of the GrIS depends crucially on the positive melt-elevation feedback (MEF), by which melt rates increase as the overall ice sheet height decreases under rising temperatures. Melting rates across Greenland have accelerated nonlinearly in recent decades, and models predict a critical temperature threshold beyond which the current ice sheet state is not maintainable. Here, we investigate long-term melt rate and ice sheet height reconstructions from the central-western GrIS in combination with model simulations to quantify the stability of this part of the GrIS. We reveal significant early-warning signals (EWS) indicating that the central-western GrIS is close to a critical transition. By relating the statistical EWS to underlying physical processes, our results suggest that the MEF plays a dominant role in the observed, ongoing destabilization of the central-western GrIS. Our results suggest substantial further GrIS mass loss in the near future and call for urgent, observation-constrained stability assessments of other parts of the GrIS.},

Systems whose fluctuations decay faster,  {$\sigma\rho$}2{$\sim\ell-\lambda$}  with  d{$<\lambda\leq$}d+1 , are called hyperuniform. The larger  {$\lambda$} , the more uniform, with systems like crystals achieving the maximum value:  {$\lambda$}=d+1 . Although finite temperature equilibrium dynamics will not yield hyperuniform states, driven, nonequilibrium dynamics may. Such is the case, for example, in a simple model where overlapping particles are each given a small random displacement. Above a critical particle density  {$\rho$}c , the system evolves forever, never finding a configuration where no particles overlap. Below  {$\rho$}c , however, it eventually finds such a state, and stops evolving. This ``absorbing state'' is hyperuniform up to a length scale  {$\xi$} , which diverges at  {$\rho$}c . An important question is whether hyperuniformity survives noise and thermal fluctuations. We find that hyperuniformity of the absorbing state is not only robust against noise, diffusion, or activity, but that such perturbations reduce fluctuations toward their limiting behavior,  {$\lambda\rightarrow$}d+1 , a uniformity similar to random close packing and early universe fluctuations, but with arbitrary controllable density.}

  abstract = {The general epidemic process (GEP), also known as susceptible-infected-recovered model, provides a minimal model of how an epidemic spreads within a population of susceptible individuals who acquire permanent immunization upon recovery. This model exhibits a second-order absorbing state phase transition, commonly studied assuming immobile healthy individuals. We investigate the impact of mobility on the scaling properties of disease spreading near the extinction threshold by introducing two generalizations of GEP, where the mobility of susceptible and recovered individuals is examined independently. In both cases, including mobility violates GEP's rapidity reversal symmetry and alters the number of absorbing states. The critical dynamics of the models are analyzed through a perturbative renormalization group (RG) approach and large-scale stochastic simulations using a Gillespie algorithm. The RG analysis predicts both models to belong to the same novel universality class describing the critical dynamics of epidemic spreading when the infected individuals interact with a diffusive species and gain immunization upon recovery. At the associated RG fixed point, the immobile species decouples from the dynamics of the infected species, dominated by the coupling with the diffusive species. Numerical simulations in two dimensions affirm our RG results by identifying the same set of critical exponents for both models. Violation of the rapidity reversal symmetry is confirmed by breaking the associated hyperscaling relation. Our study underscores the significance of mobility in shaping population spreading dynamics near the extinction threshold.},

  abstract = {Epidemics on complex networks is a widely investigated topic in the last few years, mainly due to the last pandemic events. Usually, real contact networks are dynamic, hence much effort has been invested in studying epidemics on evolving networks. Here we propose and study a model for evolving networks based on varying degrees, where at each time step a node might get, with probability r, a new degree and new neighbors according to a given degree distribution, instead of its former neighbors. We find analytically, using the generating functions framework, the epidemic threshold and the probability for a macroscopic spread of disease depending on the rewiring rate r. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations. We find that the impact of the rewiring rate r has qualitative different trends for networks having different degree distributions. That is, in some structures, such as random regular networks the dynamics enhances the epidemic spreading while in others such as scale free (SF) the dynamics reduces the spreading. In addition, we unveil that the extreme vulnerability of static SF networks, expressed by zero epidemic threshold, vanishes for only fully evolving network, r = 1, while for any partial dynamics, i.e. r {$<$} 1, this zero threshold exists. Finally, we find the epidemic threshold also for a general distribution of the recovery time. Video Abstract: Epidemics on evolving networks with varying degrees},

We prove two-loop renormalizability, obtain the two-loop {$B$}-function and show the generation of ``irreversible'' anomalous terms, resulting from the nonanalyticity of the theory, which cause statics and driven dynamics to differ at two loops. We give the exponents {$Z$} (roughness) and z (dynamics) to order {$E$}2.

  abstract = {The dynamics of planar crack fronts in hetergeneous media near the critical load for onset of crack motion are investigated both analytically and by numerical simulations. Elasticity of the solid leads to long-range stress transfer along the crack front which is nonmonotonic in time due to the elastic waves in the medium. In the quasistatic limit with instantaneous stress transfer, the crack front exhibits dynamic critical phenomenon, with a second-order-like transition from a pinned to a moving phase as the applied load is increased through a critical value. At criticality, the crack front is self-affine, with a roughness exponent {$Z$} =0.34 {\textpm}0.02. The dynamic exponent {$z$} is found to be equal to 0.74 {\textpm}0.03 and the correlation length exponent {$\nu$} =1.52 {\textpm}0.02. These results are in good agreement with those obtained from an epsilon expansion. Sound-travel time delays in the stress transfer do not change the static exponents but the dynamic exponent {$z$} becomes exactly one. Real elastic waves, however, lead to overshoots in the stresses above their eventual static value when one part of the crack front moves forward. Simplified models of these stress overshoots are used to show that overshoots are relevant at the depinning transition leading to a decrease in the critical load and an apparent jump in the velocity of the crack front directly to a nonzero value. In finite systems, the velocity also shows hysteretic behavior as a function of the loading. These results suggest a first-order-like transition. Possible implications for real tensile cracks are discussed.},

This is a generic situation occurring in solid friction, crack propagation, wetting front motion, etc. In the strong pinning limit, the dynamic of the chain is controlled by individual instabilities of each site of the chain. Long-range correlations in the displacement field and in the force field develop progressively. The system self-organizes to a steady state where the propagation of the instabilities is described by scaling laws with characteristic critical exponents. These exponents are numerically estimated through the analysis of the spatio-temporal correlation in the activity map. Tuning the exponent {$A$} of the algebraic decay of the elastic interaction with the distance is shown to give rise to three regimes: a mean-field (MF) regime valid for {$A$} {$<$}1 (very slow decay), a Laplacian regime for {$A$} {$>$}3 (rapid decay of interactions), and an intermediate regime 1 {$<A$} {$<$}3 where the critical exponents interpolate continuously between the MF and Laplacian limit cases. The latter regime is shown to display, in the range a mean-field-type character only for time correlations but not for space. The effect of the driving mode on the avalanche statistics is also analyzed.},

The first one is to replace nearest-neighbour couplings by unrestricted L{\'e}vy flights with a power-law distribution P(r){$\sim$}r-d-{$\sigma$} controlled by an exponent {$\sigma$}. Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modified by introducing waiting times {$\Delta$}t between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P({$\Delta$}t){$\sim$}({$\Delta$}t)-1-{$\kappa$}. It turns out that such systems with L{\'e}vy-distributed long-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with critical exponents varying continuously with {$\sigma$} and/or {$\kappa$} in certain ranges of the parameter space. In a field-theoretical framework such algebraically distributed long-range interactions can be accounted for by replacing the differential operators and with fractional derivatives and . As another possibility, one may introduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed the actual distance to the nearest particle. Such interactions are motivated by studies of non-equilibrium growth processes and may be interpreted as L{\'e}vy flights cut off at the actual distance to the nearest particle. In the continuum limit such truncated L{\'e}vy flights can be described to leading order by terms involving fractional powers of the density field while the differential operators remain short-ranged.},

We begin by examining binary disks in two dimensions and demonstrate that their critical states are hyperuniform as two-phase media, but not hyperuniform nor multihyperuniform as point patterns formed by the particle centroids. We further confirm the generality of our findings by studying particles with a continuous size distribution. Finally, to study the effect of rotational degrees of freedom, we extend our model to noncircular particles, namely, hard rectangles with various aspect ratios, including the hard-needle limit. Although these systems exhibit only short-range orientational order, hyperuniformity is still preserved. Our analysis reveals that the redistribution of the ``mass'' of the particles rather than the particle centroids is central to this dynamical process. The consideration of the ``active volume fraction'' of generalized random organization models may help to resolve which universality class they belong to and hence may lead to a deeper theoretical understanding of absorbing-state models. Our results suggest that general particle systems subject to random organization can be a robust way to fabricate a wide class of hyperuniform states of matter by tuning the structures via different particle-size and -shape distributions. This in turn potentially enables the creation of multifunctional hyperuniform materials with desirable optical, transport, and mechanical properties.},

Starting from random and natural homogeneous distributions of equi-sized spherical particles (disks) in an off-lattice continuous medium, particles that overlap with other particles are considered to be active and isolated particles are considered inactive. Active particles tend to repel overlapping particles. In a steady state, the particle distribution is found to be hyperuniform with a larger hyperuniformity exponent than the lattice Manna model. The critical exponents that characterize the power laws of the steady-state densities and the critical active-particle densities are calculated using both the sequential and parallel updates; they are found to be consistent, within the statistical margin of error, with those of the lattice Manna model but are distinctly different from those of the directed percolation universality class. The influence of impurities is also investigated by adding quenched point-impurity particles, and it is found that the impurity has a negligible effect on the critical behavior, supporting the universality between the continuum model and lattice Manna model. The results are in disagreement with the recent observations.},

  abstract = {Questions concerning the properties and quantification of density fluctuations in point patterns continue to provide many theoretical challenges. The purpose of this paper is to characterize certain fundamental aspects of local density fluctuations associated with general point patterns in any space dimension {$d$}. Our specific objectives are to study the variance in the number of points contained within a regularly shaped window {$\Omega$} of arbitrary size, and to further illuminate our understanding of hyperuniform systems, i.e., point patterns that do not possess infinite-wavelength fluctuations. For large windows, hyperuniform systems are characterized by a local variance that grows only as the surface area (rather than the volume) of the window. We derive two formulations for the number variance: (i) an ensemble-average formulation, which is valid for statistically homogeneous systems, and (ii) a volume-average formulation, applicable to a single realization of a general point pattern in the large-system limit. The ensemble-average formulation (which includes both real-space and Fourier representations) enables us to show that a homogeneous point pattern in a hyperuniform state is at a ``critical point'' of a type with appropriate scaling laws and critical exponents, but one in which the direct correlation function (rather than the pair correlation function) is long ranged. We also prove that the non-negativity of the local number variance does not add a new realizability condition on the pair correlation. The volume-average formulation is superior for certain computational purposes, including optimization studies in which it is desired to find the particular point pattern with an extremal or targeted value of the variance. We prove that the simple periodic linear array yields the global minimum value of the average variance among all infinite one-dimensional hyperuniform patterns. We also evaluate the variance for common infinite periodic lattices as well as certain nonperiodic point patterns in one, two, and three dimensions for spherical windows, enabling us to rank-order the spatial patterns. Our results suggest that the local variance may serve as a useful order metric for general point patterns. Contrary to the conjecture that the lattices associated with the densest packing of congruent spheres have the smallest variance regardless of the space dimension, we show that for the body-centered cubic lattice has a smaller variance than the face-centered cubic lattice. Finally, for certain hyperuniform disordered point patterns, we evaluate the direct correlation function, structure factor, and associated critical exponents exactly.},

Our experimental model system consists of polystyrene microspheres adsorbed at an oil--water interface, in which the particles exhibit small but non-negligible Brownian motion. Experiments are performed on bidisperse (1.0 and 1.2 {$\mu$}m in diameter) systems, which form area fractions of 0.20 and 0.32 at the interface. We first characterize the thermal (Brownian) noise using particle diffusivities at quiescent states, and show that under our experimental flow conditions both systems (0.20 and 0.32 area fraction) behave as athermal, in the sense that the particle diffusion time scale is larger than the flow time scale. We then characterize particle rearrangements as a function of strain amplitude, and show that small but finite levels of thermal noise affect the reversibility dynamics, even in effectively athermal systems. Our data indicate that as thermal noise is slightly increased in a cyclically sheared athermal system, the fraction of reversible rearrangements is reduced, the reversible cycles become unstable, and the rearrangement hysteresis is significantly hindered.},

In these systems, interactions mediated by hydrodynamics or elasticity are present, causing passive regions to be affected by nearby active ones. We show that mediated interactions induce a universality class of absorbing phase transitions distinct from conserved directed percolation, and we obtain the corresponding critical exponents.

  abstract = {Understanding self-organization is one of the key tasks for controlling and manipulating the structure of materials at the micro- and nanoscale. In general, self-organization is driven by interparticle potentials and is opposed by the chaotic dynamics characteristic of many driven non-equilibrium systems. Here we introduce a new model that shows how the irreversible collisions that generally produce diffusive chaotic dynamics can also cause a system to self-organize to avoid future collisions. This can lead to a self-organized non-fluctuating quiescent state, with a dynamical phase transition separating it from fluctuating diffusing states. We apply the model to recent experiments on periodically sheared particle suspensions where a transition from reversible to irreversible behaviour was observed. New experiments presented here exhibit remarkable agreement with this simple model. More generally, the model and experiments provide new insights into how driven systems can self-organize.},

The main findings are a strain amplitude ({$\gamma$}0) dependent response in the shear stress and second normal stress difference ({$N$}2). Specifically, we find a reduced viscosity, an enhanced intracycle shear thinning, the onset of a finite {$N$}2, and its frequency doubling, all near a critical strain amplitude {$\gammac$} that scales with the volume fraction {$\phi$} as {$\gammac\sim\phi-$}2. These rheological changes also signify a reversible-irreversible transition (RIT), dividing stroboscopic particle dynamics into a reversible absorbing phase (for {$\gamma$}0{$<\gammac$}) and a persistently diffusing phase (for {$\gamma$}0{$>\gammac$}). We explain the results based on two flow-induced mechanisms and elucidate their connection in the context of RIT through the underlying microstructure, which tends toward hyperuniformity near {$\gamma$}0={$\gammac$}. Overall, we expect this correspondence between rheology and emergent dynamics to hold in a wide range of settings where structural organizations are dominated by volume exclusions.},

Both the physical origin and rheological consequences associated with this nonlinear behavior are discussed and an overview is given of experimental techniques available to measure the yield stress. Recent progress is discussed concerning a microscopic theoretical description of the flow dynamics of yield stress materials, emphasizing, in particular, the role played by relaxation time scales, the interplay between shear flow and aging behavior, the existence of inhomogeneous shear flows and shear bands, wall slip, and nonlocal effects in confined geometries.},

This is illustrated through the rheological behavior of a carbon black suspension, which is shown to exhibit a viscosity bifurcation effect around a critical stress along with rheopectic trends, i.e., after a preshear at a given stress the fluid tends to accelerate when it is submitted to a lower stress. Viscosity bifurcation displays here original features: the yield stress and the critical shear rate depend on the previous flow history. The most spectacular property due to these specificities is that the material structure can be adjusted at will through an appropriate flow history. In particular it is possible to tune the material yield stress to arbitrary low values. A simple model assuming that the stress is the sum of one component due to structure deformation and one component due to hydrodynamic interactions predicts all rheological trends observed and appears to well represent quantitatively the data.},

First, we find that bidisperse, disordered foams exhibit strongly rate-dependent and inhomogeneous (shear-banded) velocity profiles, while monodisperse ordered foams are also shear banded but essentially rate independent. Second, we adapt a simple model [E. Janiaud, D. Weaire, and S. Hutzler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 038302 (2006)] based on balancing the averaged drag forces between the bubbles and the top plate {\textasciimacron}{$Fb$}â¢{$w$} and the averaged bubble-bubble drag forces {\textasciimacron}{$Fb$}â¢{$b$} by assuming that {\textasciimacron}{$Fb$}â¢{$w\simv$}2/3 and {\textasciimacron}{$Fb$}â¢{$b\sim$}({$\partialyv$}){$B$}, where {$v$} and ({$\partialyv$}) denote average bubble velocities and gradients. This model captures the observed rate-dependent flows for {$B\approx$}0.36, and the rate independent flows for {$B\approx$}0.67. Third, we perform independent rheological measurements of {\textasciimacron}{$Fb$}â¢{$w$} and {\textasciimacron}{$Fb$}â¢{$b$}, both for ordered and disordered systems, and find these to be fully consistent with the forms assumed in the simple model. Disorder thus leads to a modified effective exponent . Fourth, we vary the packing fraction of the foam over a substantial range and find that the flow profiles become increasingly shear banded when the foam is made wetter. Surprisingly, the model describes flow profiles and rate dependence over the whole range of packing fractions with the same power-law exponents---only a dimensionless number that measures the ratio of the prefactors of the viscous drag laws is seen to vary with packing fraction. We find that , where corresponds to the 2D jamming density, and suggest that this scaling follows from the geometry of the deformed facets between bubbles in contact. Overall, our work shows that the presence of disorder qualitatively changes the effective bubble-bubble drag forces and suggests a route to rationalize aspects of the ubiquitous Herschel-Bulkley (power-law) rheology observed in a wide range of disordered materials.},

Here we prove that the improved mean-field model where the mechanical noise has fat tails instead leads to {$B$}=1 with logarithmic correction. This result supports that HL is not a suitable explanation for the value of {$B$}, which is instead significantly affected by finite-dimensional effects. From considerations on elastoplastic models and on the limitation of speed at which avalanches of plasticity can propagate, we argue that {$B$}=1+1/({$d-df$}), where {$df$} is the fractal dimension of avalanches and {$d$} the spatial dimension. Measurements of {$df$} then supports that {$B\approx$}2.1 and {$B\approx$}1.7 in two and three dimensions, respectively.

  abstract = {We show that, at least at a mean-field level, the effect of structural disorder in sheared amorphous media is very dissimilar depending on the thermal or athermal nature of their underlying dynamics. We first introduce a toy model, including explicitly two types of noise (thermal versus athermal). Within this interpretation framework, we argue that mean-field athermal dynamics can be accounted for by the so-called H{\'e}braud-Lequeux (HL) model, in which the mechanical noise stems explicitly from the plastic activity in the sheared medium. Then, we show that the inclusion of structural disorder, by means of a distribution of yield energy barriers, has no qualitative effect in the HL model, while such a disorder is known to be one of the key ingredients leading kinematically to a finite macroscopic yield stress in other mean-field descriptions, such as the Soft-Glassy-Rheology model. We conclude that the statistical mechanisms at play in the emergence of a macroscopic yield stress, and a complex stationary dynamics at low shear rate, are different in thermal and athermal amorphous systems.},

Resetting occurs only beyond a threshold distance from the origin. This problem is motivated by physical realizations like soft matter under shear, where diffusion of a walk is induced by resetting events of other walks. We first reformulate in the broader context of diffusion with stochastic resetting the so-called H{\'e}braud--Lequeux model for plasticity in dense soft matter, in which diffusivity is proportional to the average resetting rate. Depending on parameter values, the response to a weak external field may be either linear, or non-linear with a non-zero average position for a vanishing applied field, and the transition between these two regimes may be interpreted as a continuous phase transition. Extending the model by considering a general power-law relation between diffusivity and average resetting rate, we notably find a discontinuous phase transition between a finite diffusivity and a vanishing diffusivity in the small field limit.},

  abstract = {Plastic events in sheared glasses are considered an example of so-called avalanches, whose sizes obey a power-law probability distribution with the avalanche critical exponent {$T$}. Although the so-called mean-field depinning (MFD) theory predicts a universal value of this exponent, {$T$}MFD=1.5, such a simplification is now known to connote qualitative disagreement with realistic systems. Numerically and experimentally, different values of {$T$} have been reported depending on the literature. Moreover, in the elastic regime, it has been noted that the critical exponent can be different from that in the steady state, and even criticality itself is a matter of debate. Because these confusingly varying results have been reported under different setups, our knowledge of avalanche criticality in sheared glasses is greatly limited. To gain a unified understanding, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive numerical investigation of avalanches in Lennard-Jones glasses under athermal quasistatic shear. In particular, by excluding the ambiguity and arbitrariness that has crept into the conventional measurement schemes, we achieve high-precision measurement and demonstrate that the exponent in the steady state follows the prediction of MFD theory, . Our results also suggest that there are two qualitatively different avalanche events. This binariness leads to the nonuniversal behavior of the avalanche size distribution and is likely to be the cause of the varying values of reported thus far. To investigate the dependence of criticality and universality on applied shear, we further study the statistics of avalanches in the elastic regime and the ensemble of the first avalanche event in different samples, which provide information about the unperturbed system. We show that while the unperturbed system is indeed off-critical, criticality gradually develops as shear is applied. The degree of criticality is encoded in the fractal dimension of the avalanches, which starts from zero in the off-critical unperturbed state and saturates in the steady state. Moreover, the critical exponent is consistent with the prediction of the MFD universally, regardless of the amount of applied shear, once the system becomes critical.},

Here, we provide the first measurement of internal scaling relations in the deformation of granular matter. By combining macroscopic force fluctuation measurements with internal strain imaging, we demonstrate the existence of robust scaling relations from particle-scale to macroscopic flow. We identify consistent power-law relations truncated by systematic pressure-dependent cutoff, in agreement with recent mean-field theory of slip avalanches in elasto-plastic materials, revealing the existence of a mechanical critical point. These results experimentally establish scale-bridging relations in the flow of matter, paving the way to a new universal theory of deformation.},

  abstract = {Domain walls in magnets, vortex lattices in superconductors, contact lines at depinning, and many other systems can be modeled as an elastic system subject to quenched disorder. The ensuing field theory possesses a well-controlled perturbative expansion around its upper critical dimension. Contrary to standard field theory, the renormalization group (RG) flow involves a function, the disorder correlator {$\Delta$}(w), and is therefore termed the functional RG. {$\Delta$}(w) is a physical observable, the auto-correlation function of the center of mass of the elastic manifold. In this review, we give a pedagogical introduction into its phenomenology and techniques. This allows us to treat both equilibrium (statics), and depinning (dynamics). Building on these techniques, avalanche observables are accessible: distributions of size, duration, and velocity, as well as the spatial and temporal shape. Various equivalences between disordered elastic manifolds, and sandpile models exist: an elastic string driven at a point and the Oslo model; disordered elastic manifolds and Manna sandpiles; charge density waves and Abelian sandpiles or loop-erased random walks. Each of the mappings between these systems requires specific techniques, which we develop, including modeling of discrete stochastic systems via coarse-grained stochastic equations of motion, super-symmetry techniques, and cellular automata. Stronger than quadratic nearest-neighbor interactions lead to directed percolation, and non-linear surface growth with additional Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) terms. On the other hand, KPZ without disorder can be mapped back to disordered elastic manifolds, either on the directed polymer for its steady state, or a single particle for its decay. Other topics covered are the relation between functional RG and replica symmetry breaking, and random-field magnets. Emphasis is given to numerical and experimental tests of the theory.},

It captures the crossover from viscous to elastic dynamics at an idealized liquid to glass transition and explains the emergence of long-ranged stress correlations in glass, as expected from classical continuum elasticity. The long-ranged stress correlations can be traced to the coupling of shear stress to transverse momentum, which is ignored in the classic Maxwell model. To rescue this widely used model, we suggest a generalization in terms of a single relaxation time {$T$} for the fast degrees of freedom only. This generalized Maxwell model implies a divergent correlation length {$\xi$} {$\proptoT$} as well as dynamic critical scaling and correctly accounts for the far-field stress correlations. It can be rephrased in terms of generalized hydrodynamic equations, which naturally couple stress and momentum and furthermore allow us to connect to fluidity and elastoplastic models.},

  abstract = {Failure and flow of amorphous materials are central to various phenomena including earthquakes and landslides. There is accumulating evidence that the yielding transition between a flowing and an arrested phase is a critical phenomenon, but the associated exponents are not understood, even at a mean-field level where the validity of popular models is debated. Here, we solve a mean-field model that captures the broad distribution of the mechanical noise generated by plasticity, whose behavior is related to biased L{\'e}vy flights near an absorbing boundary. We compute the exponent {$\theta$} characterizing the density of shear transformation {$P$}â¡({$x$}) {$\simx\theta$}, where {$x$} is the stress increment beyond which they yield. We find that after an isotropic thermal quench, {$\theta$} =1/2. However, {$\theta$} depends continuously on the applied shear stress; this dependence is not monotonic, and its value at the yield stress is not universal. The model rationalizes previously unexplained observations and captures reasonably well the value of exponents in three dimensions. Values of exponents in four dimensions are accurately predicted. These results support the fact that it is the true mean-field model that applies in large dimensions, and they raise fundamental questions about the nature of the yielding transition.},

It has been recently proposed, and subsequently questioned, that the two regimes are separated by a sharp critical point, as a function of some control parameter characterizing the intrinsic disorder strength and the degree of stability of the solid. In order to resolve this issue, we have performed extensive numerical simulations of athermally driven elastoplastic models with long-range and anisotropic realistic interaction kernels in two and three dimensions. Our results provide clear evidence for a finite-disorder critical point separating brittle and ductile yielding, and we provide an estimate of the critical exponents in 2D and 3D.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a coherent scenario of the formation of permanent shear bands in the flow of yield stress materials. It is a well accepted point of view that flow in disordered media occurs via local plastic events, corresponding to small size rearrangements, that yield a long range stress redistribution over the system. Within a minimalistic mesoscopic model that incorporates these local dynamics, we study the spatial organisation of the local plastic events. The most important parameter in this study is the typical restructuring time needed to regain the original structure after a local rearrangement. In agreement with a recent mean field study [Coussot et al., Eur. Phys. J. E, 2010, 33, 183] we observed the spontaneous formation of permanent shear bands, when this restructuring time is large compared to the typical stress release time in a rearrangement. The bands consist of a large number of plastic events within a solid region that remains elastic. This heterogeneous flow behaviour is different in nature from the transient dynamical heterogeneities that one observes in the small shear rate limit in flow without shear-banding [Martens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2011, 106, 156001]. We analyse in detail the dependence of the shear bands on system size, shear rate and restructuring time. Further, we rationalise the scenario within a mean field version of the spatial model that produces a non monotonous flow curve for large restructuring times. This explains the instability of the homogeneous flow below a critical shear rate, that corresponds to the minimum of the curve. Our study therefore strongly supports the idea that the characteristic time scales involved in the local dynamics are at the physical origin of permanent shear bands.},

While the associated depinning transition leads to scaling properties, the quadrupolar Eshelby interactions at play in amorphous plasticity induce specific additional features like shear-banding and weak ergodicity breakdown. The latters are shown to be controlled by the existence of soft modes of the elastic interaction, the consequence of which is discussed in the context of depinning.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium critical phenomena have attracted a lot of research interest in the recent decades. Similar to equilibrium critical phenomena, the concept of universality remains the major tool to order the great variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions systematically. All systems belonging to a given universality class share the same set of critical exponents, and certain scaling functions become identical near the critical point. It is known that the scaling functions vary more widely between different universality classes than the exponents. Thus, universal scaling functions offer a sensitive and accurate test for a system's universality class. On the other hand, universal scaling functions demonstrate the robustness of a given universality class impressively. Unfortunately, most studies focus on the determination of the critical exponents, neglecting the universal scaling functions. In this work a particular class of non-equilibrium critical phenomena is considered, the so-called absorbing phase transitions. Absorbing phase transitions are expected to occur in physical, chemical as well as biological systems, and a detailed introduction is presented. The universal scaling behavior of two different universality classes is analyzed in detail, namely the directed percolation and the Manna universality class. Especially, directed percolation is the most common universality class of absorbing phase transitions. The presented picture gallery of universal scaling functions includes steady state, dynamical as well as finite size scaling functions. In particular, the effect of an external field conjugated to the order parameter is investigated. Incorporating the conjugated field, it is possible to determine the equation of state, the susceptibility, and to perform a modified finite-size scaling analysis appropriate for absorbing phase transitions. Focusing on these equations, the obtained results can be applied to other non-equilibrium continuous phase transitions observed in numerical simulations or experiments. Thus, we think that the presented picture gallery of universal scaling functions is valuable for future work. Additionally to the manifestation of universality classes, universal scaling functions are useful in order to check renormalization group results quantitatively. Since the renormalization group theory is the basis of our understanding of critical phenomena, it is of fundamental interest to examine the accuracy of the obtained results. Due to the continuing improvement of computer hardware, accurate numerical data have become available, resulting in a fruitful interplay between numerical investigations and renormalization group analyzes.},

  abstract = {Amorphous systems deep blow the glass transition, as well as colloidal glasses at high packing fractions,concentrated emulsions, foam systems, etc. exhibit divergent microscopic relaxation time scales and flowonly upon a large enough external loading. This dynamical phase transition of amorphous systems fromthe apparent solid state to the apparent liquid state mediated by the external loading, is called theyielding transition. This transition is studied throughout this thesis by a mesoscopic modeling approach,specifically versions of the so-called elasto-plastic model.After introducing a general background of the glass transition and experimental systems, that are thetarget of the elasto-plastic model description, a formulation of the elasto-plastic model, slightly differentfrom the conventional ones used in the literature, is introduced for incorporating both the shear ratecontrol and the stress control protocols. It is also shown that the mean-field Hebraud-Lequeux model canbe derived from the spatially resolved elasto-plastic model by assuming some approximations.Using the shear rate control protocol, the yielding transition is firstly probed by studying the shearrate dependence of the avalanche statistics close to criticality. A crossover from a non mean-field behaviorto an apparent mean-field behavior with respect to an increasing shear rate is evidenced. Scaling laws in thezero shear rate limit, support the idea that the yielding transition belongs to a non mean-field universalityclass of a dynamical phase transition. The dependence of the symmetry of the average shape of the stressdrops on the stress drop duration, the system size and the shear rate, leads to the interpretation that stressdrops at finite shear rates result from the superposition of individual avalanches possessing a cooperativelength and time scale.By studying the macroscopic stress fluctuation, the cooperative length scale l\_c is identified as thecrossover size below which the scaling relation with the system size 1/L{\textasciicircum}d implied by the central limittheorem breaks down. Further a saturation time scale T\_c can be defined in the analysis of the timeseries of macroscopic plastic strain rate. Below this time scale one observes the manifestation of Browniandynamics. The saturation time for systems of sizes smaller than the cooperative length l\_c scales withthe system size as a power law T\_c{\textasciitilde}(l\_c){\textasciicircum}z, which can be interpreted as the scaling relation between thecooperative time and the cooperative length of individual avalanches.Further using the stress controlled protocol, the yielding transition is studied by simulating typical creep experiments of the amorphous systems. The mesoscopic models (the elasto-plastic model aswell as the mean-field H{\'e}braud-Lequeux model) are shown to be capable to reproduce the response ofthe macroscopic shear rate to an imposed stress slightly above the yielding point in qualitatively goodagreement with several experiments. Within the mesoscopic modeling approach, the results reveal thatthe creep behavior depends strongly on the initial condition of the amorphous system submitted to creepexperiments.},

Experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are hampered by limited statistical samples, and although existing stochastic models give precise exponents, they require strong assumptions about fixed deformation directions, at odds with the statistical isotropy of amorphous materials. Here, we introduce a fully tensorial, stochastic mesoscale model for amorphous plasticity that links the statistical physics of plastic yielding to engineering mechanics. It captures the complex shear patterning observed for a wide variety of deformation modes, as well as the avalanche dynamics of plastic flow. Avalanches are described by universal size exponents and scaling functions, avalanche shapes, and local stability distributions, independent of system dimensionality, boundary and loading conditions, and stress state. Our predictions consistently differ from those of mean-field depinning models, providing evidence that plastic yielding is a distinct type of critical phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Yield stress materials flow if a sufficiently large shear stress is applied. Although such materials are ubiquitous and relevant for industry, there is no accepted microscopic description of how they yield, even in the simplest situations in which temperature is negligible and in which flow inhomogeneities such as shear bands or fractures are absent. Here we propose a scaling description of the yielding transition in amorphous solids made of soft particles at zero temperature. Our description makes a connection between the Herschel--Bulkley exponent characterizing the singularity of the flow curve near the yield stress {$\Sigma$}c, the extension and duration of the avalanches of plasticity observed at threshold, and the density P(x) of soft spots, or shear transformation zones, as a function of the stress increment x beyond which they yield. We argue that the critical exponents of the yielding transition may be expressed in terms of three independent exponents, {\texttheta}, df, and z, characterizing, respectively, the density of soft spots, the fractal dimension of the avalanches, and their duration. Our description shares some similarity with the depinning transition that occurs when an elastic manifold is driven through a random potential, but also presents some striking differences. We test our arguments in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton model similar to those used in depinning, but with a different interaction kernel, and find satisfying agreement with our predictions in both two and three dimensions.}

  abstract = {Rheology aims at quantifying the response of materials to mechanical forcing. However, standard rheometers provide only global macroscopic quantities, such as viscoelastic moduli. They fail to capture the heterogeneous flow of soft amorphous materials at the mesoscopic scale, arising from the rearrangements of the microstructural elements, that must be accounted for to build predictive models. To address this experimental challenge, we have combined shear rheometry and time-resolved X-ray micro-tomography on 3D liquid foams used as model glassy materials, yielding a unique access to the stresses and contact network topology at the bubble scale. We reveal a universal scaling behavior of the local stress build-up and relaxation associated with topological modifications. Moreover, these plastic events redistribute stress non-locally, as if the foam were an elastic medium subjected to a quadrupolar deformation. Our findings clarify how the macroscopic elastoplastic behavior of amorphous materials emerges from the spatiotemporal stress variations induced by microstructural rearrangements.},

The good agreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions in the STZ volumes provides compelling evidence that the plastic flow of metallic glasses occurs through cooperative shearing of unstable STZs activated by shear stresses. Moreover, the ductility of BMGs was found to intrinsically correlate with their STZ volumes. The experiments presented herein pave a way to gain a quantitative insight into the atomic-scale mechanisms of BMG mechanical behavior.}

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations with varying damping are used to examine the effects of inertia and spatial dimension on sheared disordered solids in the athermal quasistatic limit. In all cases the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power law over at least three orders of magnitude in dissipated energy or stress drop. Scaling exponents are determined using finite-size scaling for systems with 103--106 particles. Three distinct universality classes are identified corresponding to overdamped and underdamped limits, as well as a crossover damping that separates the two regimes. For each universality class, the exponent describing the avalanche distributions is the same in two and three dimensions. The spatial extent of plastic deformation is proportional to the energy dissipated in an avalanche. Both rise much more rapidly with system size in the underdamped limit where inertia is important. Inertia also lowers the mean energy of configurations sampled by the system and leads to an excess of large events like that seen in earthquake distributions for individual faults. The distribution of stress values during shear narrows to zero with increasing system size and may provide useful information about the size of elemental events in experimental systems. For overdamped and crossover systems the stress variation scales inversely with the square root of the system size. For underdamped systems the variation is determined by the size of the largest events.},

The resulting mechanical properties are close to the behavior found experimentally. At small strains, the pristine systems are akin to other glassy systems with a so-called gap distribution with a small positive exponent. Critical avalanching behavior is found only approaching the yield point. The post-yield stress drops are universal, and the gap distribution becomes flat.},

The generaliza- tion to 3' was given by Box et al. (1). Good (2) generalized these methods and gave elegant algorithms for which one class of applications is the calculation of Fourier series. In their full generality, Good's methods are applicable to certain problems in which one must multiply an N-vector by an N X N matrix which can be factored into m sparse matrices, where m is proportional to log N. This results inma procedure requiring a number of operations proportional to N log N rather than N2. These methods are applied here to the calculation of complex Fourier series. They are useful in situations where the number of data points is, or can be chosen to be, a highly composite number. The algorithm is here derived and presented in a rather different form. Attention is given to the choice of N. It is also shown how special advantage can be obtained in the use of a binary computer with N = 2' and how the entire calculation can be performed within the array of N data storage locations used for the given Fourier coefficients.

To describe these heterogeneous processes, elastoplastic models handle the material as a collection of ``mesoscopic'' blocks alternating between an elastic behavior and plastic relaxation, when they are loaded above a threshold. Plastic relaxation events redistribute stresses in the system in a very anisotropic way. A review is given of not only the physical insight provided by these models into practical issues such as strain localization, creep, and steady-state rheology, but also the fundamental questions that they address with respect to criticality at the yielding point and the statistics of avalanches of plastic events. Furthermore, connections are discussed with concurrent mean-field approaches and with related problems such as the plasticity of crystals and the depinning of an elastic line.},

  abstract = {We analyze the behavior of different elastoplastic models approaching the yielding transition. We propose two kinds of rules for the local yielding events: yielding occurs above the local threshold either at a constant rate or with a rate that increases as the square root of the stress excess. We establish a family of ``static'' universal critical exponents which do not depend on this dynamic detail of the model rules: in particular, the exponents for the avalanche size distribution P(S) {$\sim$} S-{$\tau$}Sf(S/Ldf) and the exponents describing the density of sites at the verge of yielding, which we find to be of the form P(x) {$\simeq$} P(0) + x{\texttheta} with P(0) {$\sim$} L-a controlling the extremal statistics. On the other hand, we discuss ``dynamical'' exponents that are sensitive to the local yielding rule. We find that, apart form the dynamical exponent z controlling the duration of avalanches, also the flowcurve's (inverse) Herschel--Bulkley exponent {$\beta$} ( {$\sim$} ({$\sigma$} - {$\sigma$}c){$\beta$}) enters in this category, and is seen to differ in {$\frac{1}{2}$} between the two yielding rate cases. We give analytical support to this numerical observation by calculating the exponent variation in the H{\'e}braud--Lequeux model and finding an identical shift. We further discuss an alternative mean-field approximation to yielding only based on the so-called Hurst exponent of the accumulated mechanical noise signal, which gives good predictions for the exponents extracted from simulations of fully spatial models.},
