Highlighting the use of transforms and their properties, this latest edition of the bestseller begins with a solid introduction to signals and systems, including properties of the delta function and some classical orthogonal functions.It then goes on to detail different transforms, including lapped, Mellin, wavelet, and Hartley varieties. Written by top experts, each chapter provides numerous examples and applications that clearly demonstrate the unique purpose and properties of each type. The material is presented in a way that makes it easy for readers from different backgrounds to familiarize themselves with the wide range of transform applications.

	abstract = {Close to the yielding transition, amorphous solids exhibit a jerky dynamics characterized by plastic avalanches. The statistics of these avalanches have been measured experimentally and numerically using a variety of different triggering protocols, assuming that all of them were equivalent for this purpose. In particular, two main classes of protocols have been studied, deformation under controlled strain or under controlled stress. In this work, we investigate different protocols to generate plasticity avalanches and conduct two-dimensional simulations of an elastoplastic model to examine the protocol dependence of avalanche statistics in yield-stress fluids. We demonstrate that when stress is controlled, the value and even the existence of the exponent governing the probability distribution function of avalanche sizes strongly depend on the protocol chosen to initiate avalanches. This confirms in finite dimension a scenario presented in a previous mean-field analysis. We identify a consistent stress-controlled protocol whose associated avalanches differ from the quasi-static ones in their fractal dimension and dynamical exponent. Remarkably, this protocol also seems to satisfy the scaling relations among exponents previously proposed. Our results underscore the necessity for a cautious interpretation of avalanche universality within elastoplastic models, and more generally within systems where several control parameters exist.},

At sufficiently high temperature and driving rates, flow is continuous and described by well-established rheological flow laws such as Herschel–Bulkley and logarithmic rate dependence. However, we find that these flow laws change in the regime of intermittent flow, where collective events no longer overlap and serrated flow becomes pronounced. In this regime, we identify a thermal activation stress scale, xa(T,), that wholly captures the effect of driving rate and temperature T on average flow stress, stress drop (avalanche) size and correlation lengths. Different rheological regimes are summarized in a dynamic phase diagram for the amorphous yielding transition. Theoretical predictions call for a need to re-examine the rheology of very slowly sheared amorphous matter much below the glass transition.},

	abstract = {The larger structures are, the lower their mechanical strength. Already discussed by Leonardo da Vinci and Edmé Mariotte several centuries ago, size effects on strength remain of crucial importance in modern engineering for the elaboration of safety regulations in structural design or the extrapolation of laboratory results to geophysical field scales. Under tensile loading, statistical size effects are traditionally modeled with a weakest-link approach. One of its prominent results is a prediction of vanishing strength at large scales that can be quantified in the framework of extreme value statistics. Despite a frequent use outside its range of validity, this approach remains the dominant tool in the field of statistical size effects. Here we focus on compressive failure, which concerns a wide range of geophysical and geotechnical situations. We show on historical and recent experimental data that weakest-link predictions are not obeyed. In particular, the mechanical strength saturates at a nonzero value toward large scales. Accounting explicitly for the elastic interactions between defects during the damage process, we build a formal analogy of compressive failure with the depinning transition of an elastic manifold. This critical transition interpretation naturally entails finite-size scaling laws for the mean strength and its associated variability. Theoretical predictions are in remarkable agreement with measurements reported for various materials such as rocks, ice, coal, or concrete. This formalism, which can also be extended to the flowing instability of granular media under multiaxial compression, has important practical consequences for future design rules.},

	abstract = {In a forest fire model with immune trees (FFMIT) recently proposed by Drossel and Schwabl (Physica A 199 (1993) 183), the sites of the lattice are either empty, a tree or a burning tree, and at each time step the system is updated in parallel according to the following rules: (i) A burning tree becomes an empty site, (ii) trees grow with probability p from empty sites, and (iii) a green tree becomes a burning tree with probability (1-g) if at least one next neighbor is burning. Fixing an arbitrary grow probability (p) and starting with a small immunity (g), increments of g causes the fire density of the steady state to decrease until the fire becomes irreversibly extinguished at a certain critical point of coordinates \{pc, gc\}. The set of critical points defines a critical curve gc (p) which, in the L = ∞ limit, divides the \{p, g\}-plane in two regions: a steady state with fire fronts for g {\textless} gc(p) and an unique absorbing state with all sites occupied by green trees for g ≥ gc(p). It is shown, by means of an epidemic spreading analysis that the continuous irreversible phase transition between the stationary regime and the absorbing state belongs to the same universality class as Reggeon field theory. It is found that within the absorbing state time correlations are short-ranged and that the fire density decrease exponentially. Within the stationary regime the irreversible transition is studied in terms of the finite-size scaling theory that was already developed to describe reversible transitions. The results reported in this work show that problems emerging from (apparently) unrelated branches of science such as particle physics, catalysis, directed percolation, and epidemic spreading can be understood by means of a unified description.},

Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabu­lated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel unsteady shear protocol, which we name Rotary Shear (RS), where the flow and vorticity directions are continuously rotated around the velocity gradient direction by imposing two out-of-phase oscillatory shear (OS) in orthogonal directions. We perform numerical simulations of dense suspensions of rigid non-Brownian spherical particles at volume fractions (\${\textbackslash}phi\$) between 0.40 and 0.55 subject to this new RS protocol and compare to the classical OS protocol. We find that the suspension viscosity displays a similar non-monotonic response as the strain amplitude (\${\textbackslash}gamma\_0\$) is increased: a minimum viscosity is found at an intermediate, volume-fraction dependent strain amplitude. However, the suspension dynamics is different in the new protocol. Unlike the OS protocol, suspensions under RS do not show self-adsorbing states at any \${\textbackslash}gamma\_0\$ and do not undergo the reversible-irreversible transition: the stroboscropic particle dynamics are always diffusive, which we attribute to the fact that the RS protocol is irreversible. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce a reversible-RS (RRS) protocol, a combination of RS and OS, where we rotate the shear direction (as in RS) until it is instantaneously reversed (as in OS), and find the resulting rheology and dynamics to be closer to OS. Detailed microstructure analysis shows that both the OS and RRS protocols result in a contact-free, isotropic to an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure at the dynamically reversible-to-irreversible transition. The RS protocol does not render such a transition, and the dynamics remain diffusive with an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure for all strain amplitudes.},

	abstract = {We present a pedagogical introduction to self-organized criticality (SOC), unraveling its connections with nonequilibrium phase transitions. There are several paths from a conventional critical point to SOC. They begin with an absorbing-state phase transition (directed percolation is a familiar example), and impose supervision or driving on the system; two commonly used methods are extremal dynamics, and driving at a rate approaching zero. We illustrate this in sandpiles, where SOC is a consequence of slow driving in a system exhibiting an absorbing-state phase transition with a conserved density. Other paths to SOC, in driven interfaces, the Bak-Sneppen model, and self- organized directed percolation, are also examined. We review the status of experimental realizations of SOC in light of these observations.},

The solid is assumed to be either flat, but chemically heterogeneous (this in turn modulating the interfacial tensions), or rough. For weak heterogeneities, we expect no hysteresis, but the contact line becomes wiggly. For stronger heterogeneities, we first discuss the behavior of the contact line in the presence of a single, localized defect, and show that there may exist two stable positions for the line, obtained by a simple graphic construction. Hysteresis shows up when the strength of the defect is above a certain threshold. Extending this to a dilute system of defects, we obtain formulas for the ‘‘advancing’’ and ‘‘receding’’ contact angles θa, θr, in terms of the distribution of defect strength and defect sharpness. These formulas might be tested by controlled contamination of a solid surface.},

	abstract = {The concept of self-organized criticality was introduced to explain the behaviour of the sandpile model. In this model, particles are randomly dropped onto a square grid of boxes. When a box accumulates four particles they are redistributed to the four adjacent boxes or lost off the edge of the grid. Redistributions can lead to further instabilities with the possibility of more particles being lost from the grid, contributing to the size of each avalanche. These model 'avalanches' satisfied a power-law frequency-area distribution with a slope near unity. Other cellular-automata models, including the slider-block and forest-fire models, are also said to exhibit self-organized critical behaviour. It has been argued that earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, and species extinctions are examples of self-organized criticality in nature. In addition, wars and stock market crashes have been associated with this behaviour. The forest-fire model is particularly interesting in terms of its relation to the critical-point behaviour of the site-percolation model. In the basic forest-fire model, trees are randomly planted on a grid of points. Periodically in time, sparks are randomly dropped on the grid. If a spark drops on a tree, that tree and adjacent trees burn in a model fire. The fires are the `avalanches' and they are found to satisfy power-law frequency-area distributions with slopes near unity. This forest-fire model is closely related to the site-percolation model, that exhibits critical behaviour. In the forest-fire model there is an inverse cascade of trees from small clusters to large clusters, trees are lost primarily from model fires that destroy the largest clusters. This quasi steady-state cascade gives a power-law frequency-area distribution for both clusters of trees and smaller fires. The site-percolation model is equivalent to the forest-fire model without fires. In this case there is a transient cascade of trees from small to large clusters and a power-law distribution is found only at a critical density of trees.},

Away from this line, an additional memory term arises in the interface dynamics; we argue that this does not change the universality class.

The survey gives a general introduction to various lattice models of directed percolation and studies their scaling properties, field-theoretic aspects, numerical techniques, as well as possible experimental realizations. In addition, several examples of absorbing-state transitions which do not belong to the directed percolation universality class will be discussed. As a closely related technique, we investigate the concept of damage spreading. It is shown that this technique is ambiguous to some extent, making it impossible to define chaotic and regular phases in stochastic non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we discuss various classes of depinning transitions in models for interface growth which are related to phase transitions into absorbing states.},

In each experiment, we deform the glass in pure shear at a constant strain rate [(1–5)×⁢10−5 s−1] to maximum macroscopic strains (5\%–10\%) and then reverse the deformation at the same rate to return to zero macroscopic strain. We also measure three-dimensional particle trajectories in an identically prepared quiescent glass in which the macroscopic strain is always zero. We find that shear transformation zones exist and are active in both sheared and quiescent colloidal glasses, revealed by a distinctive fourfold signature in spatial autocorrelations of the local shear strain. With increasing shear, the population of local shear transformations develops more quickly than in a quiescent glass and many of these transformations are irreversible. When the macroscopic strain is reversed, we observe partial elastic recovery, followed by plastic deformation of the opposite sign, required to compensate for the irreversibly transformed regions. The average diameter of the shear transformation zones in both strained and quiescent glasses is slightly more than two particle diameters.},

	abstract = {Soft glassy materials far from their glass transition (low temperature, high density) exhibit divergent relaxation timescales and behave essentially as solids in absence of driving or biological activity.In this thesis, we investigate the dynamics, rheology and large scale organization of various types of (athermal) soft amorphous materials resulting either from an externally imposed driving (shear or vibration), from a local activity, or both.The main question behind the different projects constituting this thesis is: how do distinct sources of mechanical noise affect the fluidization and large scale organization of soft amorphous materials and how to account for it in coarse-grained descriptions?To this aim, we use a multi-scale modeling approach, from microscopic simulations to continuum modeling, with a main focus on mesoscale elasto-plastic models.The first topic of this thesis concerns shear localization in the flow of soft amorphous materials. We first consider the case of inertial dynamics at the microscopic scale as a rate-weakening mechanisms and show, using a continuum model, that permanent shear bands observed in particle-based simulations can be explained in terms of softening due to kinetic heating of the system under shear, with a shear rate dependent kinetic temperature.In a second part, we study how permanent shear bands are affected by an external (rate-independent) source of noise leading to the random activation of plastic rearrangements.We show, using a mesoscale elasto-plastic model with two different models of noise, that an increasing external noise leads to vanishing shear bands, and that the transition from heterogeneous to homogeneous flow can be interpreted as a nonequilibrium critical point. Our findings suggest that the critical exponents associated with this transition do not depend on the details of the activation dynamics for the noise, and are also consistent with recent experimental results on vibrated granular media.Fluidization by a rate-independent noise is an ubiquitous phenomenon, observed not only in vibrated granular media, but also in active or biological systems, where the noise if of active origin.In a third part, we study how active sources of noise resulting from the active deformation of particles can induce a fluidization of the system.Using inputs from microscopic simulations, we build a tensorial mesoscale elasto-plastic model for the dynamics of actively deforming particles.We show that this model reproduces the discontinuous fluidization transition observed in particle-based simulations and shares analogy with inert amorphous systems driven with an oscillatory shear protocol.In a last part, motivated by experiments in the lab, we consider a vertex-based model to study oscillations of the migration velocity of cells in confined epithelial tissues. We find that a feedback mechanism between the cell self-propulsion direction and velocity is required to observe oscillations, and that the type of oscillation observed depends upon the confinement length as reported in experiments.},

Advocates of the true yield stress picture have demonstrated that the effective viscosity increases very rapidly as the stress is decreased towards the yield stress. Opponents have shown that this viscosity increase levels off, and that the material behaves as a Newtonian fluid of very high viscosity below the yield stress. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally (on four different materials, using three different rheometers, five different geometries, and two different measurement methods) that the low-stress Newtonian viscosity is an artifact that arises in non–steady-state experiments. For measurements as long as 104 seconds we find that the value of the “Newtonian viscosity” increases indefinitely. This proves that the yield stress exists and marks a sharp transition between flowing states and states where the steady-state viscosity is infinite —a solid!},

Their multiphasic composition leads to a complex rheological behavior that is useful in numerous applications, from oil recovery to food/cosmetic processing. Their structure is very similar to the one of emulsions, so that both materials share common mechanical properties. In particular, the presence of surfactants at the gas–liquid interfaces leads to peculiar interfacial and dissipative properties. Foam rheology has been an active research topics and is already reported in several reviews, most of them covering rheometry measurements at the scale of the foam, coupled with interpretations at the local scale of bubbles or interfaces. In this review, we start following this approach, then we try to cover the multiscale features of aqueous foam flows, emphasizing regimes where intermediate length scales need to be taken into account or regimes fast enough regarding internal time scales so that the flow goes beyond the quasi-static limit.
Résumé
Les mousses aqueuses sont des suspensions de bulles à l'intérieur de phases aqueuses. Leur caractère multiphasique conduit à un comportement rhéologique complexe qui est utile dans de nombreuses applications, depuis la récupération du pétrole jusqu'aux industries alimentaire et cosmétique. Leur structure est très similaire à celle des émulsions, de telle sorte que ces deux types de matériaux partagent des propriétés mécaniques communes. En particulier, la présence de surfactants aux interfaces gaz–liquide mène à des propriétés interfaciales et dissipatives particulières. La rhéologie des mousses constitue un champ de recherche actif et a déjà été évoquée dans plusieurs revues, la plupart d'entre elles couvrant des mesures rhéométriques à l'échelle de la mousse, couplées avec des interprétations à l'échelle locale des bulles et des interfaces. Nous commençons cette revue en suivant cette approche, puis nous tentons de couvrir les caractéristiques multi-échelles des écoulements de mousses liquides, en insistant sur les régimes où des échelles de longueur intermédiaires doivent être prises en compte, ou sur les régimes suffisamment rapides pour que l'écoulement sorte de la limite quasi statique.},

	abstract = {The shear-induced self-diffusion and rheology of concentrated suspensions of noncolloidal hard spheres have been studied experimentally. The combined results provide an interesting physical picture. The projection of the trajectories of individual particles on the vorticity (z)–velocity (x) plane were determined through particle tracking. The particle trajectories turned out to be very useful for gaining qualitative insight into the microscopic particle motion. However, the technique is less suitable to obtain quantitative information. For a quantitative analysis of the particle displacements we measured the evolution of the ensemble averaged displacements as a function of time. The statistical analysis revealed two diffusion regimes, where 〈ΔzΔz〉∼γ̇Δt. For large strain values (γ̇Δt\&gt;1) long-time self-diffusion was observed. The associated diffusion coefficient D̂∞ is in excellent agreement with literature data on shear-induced self-diffusion. On very short times (γ̇Δt≪1) a novel diffusive regime was discovered, characterized by a diffusion coefficient D̂0, which is significantly smaller than D̂∞ and grows monotonically with φ. D̂0 is detected on time scales on which the particle configuration is not changed significantly and thus it must represent the fluctuating motion of particles in the “cage” formed by their nearest neighbors. Finally, the rheology was studied with steady shear and oscillatory rheometry. The dynamic measurements in a controlled stress rheometer revealed that the viscoelastic response of the suspension is determined mainly by the amplitude of deformation. At small strain amplitudes γ0\&lt;1, the response is linear and a dynamic viscosity η′ is found, which is in excellent agreement with the high frequency limit η∞′ as reported in literature for colloidal hard sphere suspensions. Around γ0=1 the “cage” around a particle is deformed and a shear-induced microstructure is built. This leads to O(a) displacements of the particles and the viscoelastic response becomes strongly nonharmonic. Although the effect persists at large amplitudes, it becomes relatively small for γ0≫1. The microstructure is rearranged immediately after flow reversal and remains unchanged for the larger part of the period of oscillation. As a result a pseudolinear viscoelastic regime is found with a viscosity close to steady shear viscosity. Experiments show a correlation between the time scales controlling the D̂0/D̂∞ diffusive behavior and the ones controlling the shear-induced changes in particle configuration as probed by the rheological measurements.},

The critical exponent for B-driven RIT is in agreement with that for d-driven RIT and both types of RIT fall into the same universality class as the absorbing transition in the two-dimensional directed-percolation universality class. As d is decreased to the average intervortex spacing in the reversible regime, \$\${\textbackslash}tau (d)\$\$shows a significant drop, indicating a transition or crossover from a loop-reversible state with vortex-vortex collisions to a collisionless point-reversible state. In either regime, \$\${\textbackslash}tau (d)\$\$exhibits a power-law divergence at the same \$\$d\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm \{c\}\}\$\$with nearly the same exponent.},

W is found to scale with the length L of the line as L ζ with a roughness exponent ζ = 0.51±0.03. This value is similar to the one obtained with superfluid helium.

	abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a potentially unstable component of the Earth system and may exhibit a critical transition under ongoing global warming. Mass reductions of the GrIS have substantial impacts on global sea level and the speed of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, due to the additional freshwater caused by increased meltwater runoff into the northern Atlantic. The stability of the GrIS depends crucially on the positive melt-elevation feedback (MEF), by which melt rates increase as the overall ice sheet height decreases under rising temperatures. Melting rates across Greenland have accelerated nonlinearly in recent decades, and models predict a critical temperature threshold beyond which the current ice sheet state is not maintainable. Here, we investigate long-term melt rate and ice sheet height reconstructions from the central-western GrIS in combination with model simulations to quantify the stability of this part of the GrIS. We reveal significant early-warning signals (EWS) indicating that the central-western GrIS is close to a critical transition. By relating the statistical EWS to underlying physical processes, our results suggest that the MEF plays a dominant role in the observed, ongoing destabilization of the central-western GrIS. Our results suggest substantial further GrIS mass loss in the near future and call for urgent, observation-constrained stability assessments of other parts of the GrIS.},

	abstract = {The general epidemic process (GEP), also known as susceptible-infected-recovered model, provides a minimal model of how an epidemic spreads within a population of susceptible individuals who acquire permanent immunization upon recovery. This model exhibits a second-order absorbing state phase transition, commonly studied assuming immobile healthy individuals. We investigate the impact of mobility on the scaling properties of disease spreading near the extinction threshold by introducing two generalizations of GEP, where the mobility of susceptible and recovered individuals is examined independently. In both cases, including mobility violates GEP’s rapidity reversal symmetry and alters the number of absorbing states. The critical dynamics of the models are analyzed through a perturbative renormalization group (RG) approach and large-scale stochastic simulations using a Gillespie algorithm. The RG analysis predicts both models to belong to the same novel universality class describing the critical dynamics of epidemic spreading when the infected individuals interact with a diffusive species and gain immunization upon recovery. At the associated RG fixed point, the immobile species decouples from the dynamics of the infected species, dominated by the coupling with the diffusive species. Numerical simulations in two dimensions affirm our RG results by identifying the same set of critical exponents for both models. Violation of the rapidity reversal symmetry is confirmed by breaking the associated hyperscaling relation. Our study underscores the significance of mobility in shaping population spreading dynamics near the extinction threshold.},

	abstract = {Epidemics on complex networks is a widely investigated topic in the last few years, mainly due to the last pandemic events. Usually, real contact networks are dynamic, hence much effort has been invested in studying epidemics on evolving networks. Here we propose and study a model for evolving networks based on varying degrees, where at each time step a node might get, with probability r, a new degree and new neighbors according to a given degree distribution, instead of its former neighbors. We find analytically, using the generating functions framework, the epidemic threshold and the probability for a macroscopic spread of disease depending on the rewiring rate r. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations. We find that the impact of the rewiring rate r has qualitative different trends for networks having different degree distributions. That is, in some structures, such as random regular networks the dynamics enhances the epidemic spreading while in others such as scale free (SF) the dynamics reduces the spreading. In addition, we unveil that the extreme vulnerability of static SF networks, expressed by zero epidemic threshold, vanishes for only fully evolving network, r = 1, while for any partial dynamics, i.e. r {\textless} 1, this zero threshold exists. Finally, we find the epidemic threshold also for a general distribution of the recovery time. Video Abstract: Epidemics on evolving networks with varying degrees},

Je dérive la forme d’échelle universelle des fonctions de corrélation du champ des vitesses locales. Cela permet de tester la classe d’universalité de la transition, ainsi que la portée des interactions. J’étudie aussi la statistique des clusters qui se forment en présence d’interactions à longue-portée et montre comment celle-ci est reliée à la statistique des avalanches globales.

	abstract = {This review article gives an overview of recent progress in the ﬁeld of non-equilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states with long-range interactions. It focuses on two possible types of long-range interactions. The ﬁrst one is to replace nearest-neighbor couplings by unrestricted L´evy ﬂights with a power-law distribution P (r) ∼ r−d−σ controlled by an exponent σ. Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modiﬁed by introducing waiting times ∆t between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P (∆t) ∼ (∆t)−1−κ. It turns out that such systems with L´evy-distributed long-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with critical exponents varying continuously with σ and/or κ in certain ranges of the parameter space. In a ﬁeld-theoretical framework such algebraically distributed longrange interactions can be accounted for by replacing the diﬀerential operators ∇2 and ∂t with fractional derivatives ∇˜ σ and ∂˜tκ. As another possibility, one may introduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed the actual distance to the nearest particle. Such interactions are motivated by studies of non-equilibrium growth processes and may be interpreted as L´evy ﬂights cut oﬀ at the actual distance to the nearest particle. In the continuum limit such truncated L´evy ﬂights can be described to leading order by terms involving fractional powers of the density ﬁeld while the diﬀerential operators remain short-ranged.},

We find that single particle dynamics becomes intermittent and strongly non-Fickian, and that collective dynamics becomes spatially correlated over diverging length scales.

Starting from random and natural homogeneous distributions of equi-sized spherical particles (disks) in an off-lattice continuous medium, particles that overlap with other particles are considered to be active and isolated particles are considered inactive. Active particles tend to repel overlapping particles. In a steady state, the particle distribution is found to be hyperuniform with a larger hyperuniformity exponent than the lattice Manna model. The critical exponents that characterize the power laws of the steady-state densities and the critical active-particle densities are calculated using both the sequential and parallel updates; they are found to be consistent, within the statistical margin of error, with those of the lattice Manna model but are distinctly different from those of the directed percolation universality class. The influence of impurities is also investigated by adding quenched point-impurity particles, and it is found that the impurity has a negligible effect on the critical behavior, supporting the universality between the continuum model and lattice Manna model. The results are in disagreement with the recent observations.},

Our experimental model system consists of polystyrene microspheres adsorbed at an oil–water interface, in which the particles exhibit small but non-negligible Brownian motion. Experiments are performed on bidisperse (1.0 and 1.2 μm in diameter) systems, which form area fractions of 0.20 and 0.32 at the interface. We first characterize the thermal (Brownian) noise using particle diffusivities at quiescent states, and show that under our experimental flow conditions both systems (0.20 and 0.32 area fraction) behave as athermal, in the sense that the particle diffusion time scale is larger than the flow time scale. We then characterize particle rearrangements as a function of strain amplitude, and show that small but finite levels of thermal noise affect the reversibility dynamics, even in effectively athermal systems. Our data indicate that as thermal noise is slightly increased in a cyclically sheared athermal system, the fraction of reversible rearrangements is reduced, the reversible cycles become unstable, and the rearrangement hysteresis is significantly hindered.},

We consider a more general situation with nonuniform strain (e.g., oscillatory channel flow), which is observed to exhibit markedly different dynamics. The onset of irreversibility is delayed, and occurs simultaneously across the entire channel. This behavior is only partially explained by self-organization and shear-induced migration. The onset is accompanied by long-range correlated particle motion even at the channel center, where the strain is negligible; this motion prevents the system from evolving into a reversible state.},

This is a consequence of the time-reversible equations of motion, at least for two-dimensional flows. But in more complex flows, such as those in three-dimensional or rigorously stirred systems, this delicate effect is destroyed. An investigation of a slowly sheared suspension of solid particles now reveals the microscopic processes behind this transition to irreversible behaviour. Beyond a concentration-dependent threshold strain, irreversibility sets in as a result of chaotic collisions between the particles.},

	abstract = {Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems.   Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required. In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places:  Mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables)  Exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12)  Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2)  Confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2)  Hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2)  Elliptic integrals (9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions (3)  Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13)  Combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11)  Probability functions (ll); scales of notation (6); miscellaneous functions (9)  Laplace transforms (2); and others Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over 100 figures illustrate the text. In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem-solving, experimentation and field work. This edition contains every page of the original government publication.Dover is widely recognized for a magnificent mathematics list featuring such world-class theorists as Paul J. Cohen (Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis), Alfred Tarski (Undecidable Theories), Gary Chartrand (Introductory Graph Theory), Hermann Weyl (The Concept of a Riemann Surface), Shlomo Sternberg (Dynamical Systems), and multiple works by C. R. Wylie in geometry, plus Stanley J. Farlow's Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers.},

	abstract = {The velocity fluctuations present in macroscopically homogeneous suspensions of neutrally buoyant non-Brownian spheres undergoing simple shear flow, and their dependence on the microstructure developed by the suspensions, are investigated in the limit of vanishingly small Reynolds numbers using Stokesian dynamics simulations. We show that, in the dilute limit, the standard deviation of the velocity fluctuations (the so-called suspension temperature) is proportional to the volume fraction, in both the transverse and the flow directions, and that a theoretical prediction, which considers only the hydrodynamic interactions between isolated pairs of spheres, is in good agreement with the numerical results at low concentrations. We also simulate the velocity fluctuations that would result from a random hard-sphere distribution of spheres in simple shear flow, and thereby investigate the effects of the microstructure on the velocity fluctuations. Analogous results are discussed for the fluctuations in the angular velocity of the suspended spheres. In addition, we present the probability density functions for all the linear and angular velocity components, and for three different concentrations, showing a transition from a Gaussian to an exponential and finally to a stretched exponential functional form as the volume fraction is decreased.The simulations include a non-hydrodynamic repulsive force between the spheres which, although extremely short range, leads to the development of fore–aft asymmetric distributions for large enough volume fractions, if the range of that force is kept unchanged. On the other hand, we show that, although the pair distribution function recovers its fore–aft symmetry in dilute suspensions, it remains anisotropic and that this anisotropy can be accurately predicted theoretically from the two-sphere solution by assuming the complete absence of any permanent doublets of spheres.We also present a simple correction to the analysis of laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements, which substantially improves the interpretation of these measurements at low volume fractions even though it involves only the angular velocity of a single sphere in the vorticity direction.Finally, in an Appendix, we show that, in the dilute limit, the whole velocity autocorrelation function can be predicted using again only two-particle encounters.},

In general, self-organization is driven by interparticle potentials and is opposed by the chaotic dynamics characteristic of many driven non-equilibrium systems. Here we introduce a new model that shows how the irreversible collisions that generally produce diffusive chaotic dynamics can also cause a system to self-organize to avoid future collisions. This can lead to a self-organized non-fluctuating quiescent state, with a dynamical phase transition separating it from fluctuating diffusing states. We apply the model to recent experiments on periodically sheared particle suspensions where a transition from reversible to irreversible behaviour was observed. New experiments presented here exhibit remarkable agreement with this simple model. More generally, the model and experiments provide new insights into how driven systems can self-organize.},

We performed simple shear tests at different temperatures (1–300 K), shear rates (108–1010 s–1) and pressures (0–10 GPa), from which we investigate the atomic rearrangements induced by loading. At low strain, atomic rearrangements, as detected by a non-affine displacement criteria, nucleate randomly in the glass. They then give rise to the formation of shear bands once the steady state of plastic flow is reached. We show that the flow stress follows a Herschel-Buckley law modified to account for the thermal activation of plastic events.},

We find that the flow curves follow a Herschel-Bulkley law, whatever is the bond rigidity, with an exponent close to 0.5. Interestingly, the apparent viscosity can be related to a single relevant time scale t rel, suggesting a strong connection between the local dynamics and the global mechanical behaviour. We propose a model based on the competition between the nucleation and the avalanche-like propagation of spatial strain heterogeneities. This model can explain the Herschel-Bulkley exponent on the basis of the size dependence of the heterogeneities on the shear rate. Graphical abstract},

All these disordered materials display a nonlinear flow behavior in response to external mechanical forces due to the existence of a finite force threshold for flow to occur: the yield stress. Both the physical origin and rheological consequences associated with this nonlinear behavior are discussed and an overview is given of experimental techniques available to measure the yield stress. Recent progress is discussed concerning a microscopic theoretical description of the flow dynamics of yield stress materials, emphasizing, in particular, the role played by relaxation time scales, the interplay between shear flow and aging behavior, the existence of inhomogeneous shear flows and shear bands, wall slip, and nonlocal effects in confined geometries.},

This is illustrated through the rheological behavior of a carbon black suspension, which is shown to exhibit a viscosity bifurcation effect around a critical stress along with rheopectic trends, i.e., after a preshear at a given stress the fluid tends to accelerate when it is submitted to a lower stress. Viscosity bifurcation displays here original features: the yield stress and the critical shear rate depend on the previous flow history. The most spectacular property due to these specificities is that the material structure can be adjusted at will through an appropriate flow history. In particular it is possible to tune the material yield stress to arbitrary low values. A simple model assuming that the stress is the sum of one component due to structure deformation and one component due to hydrodynamic interactions predicts all rheological trends observed and appears to well represent quantitatively the data.},

	abstract = {We probe the flow of two-dimensional (2D) foams, consisting of a monolayer of bubbles sandwiched between a liquid bath and glass plate, as a function of driving rate, packing fraction, and degree of disorder. First, we find that bidisperse, disordered foams exhibit strongly rate-dependent and inhomogeneous (shear-banded) velocity profiles, while monodisperse ordered foams are also shear banded but essentially rate independent. Second, we adapt a simple model [E. Janiaud, D. Weaire, and S. Hutzler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 038302 (2006)] based on balancing the averaged drag forces between the bubbles and the top plate ¯𝐹𝑏⁢𝑤 and the averaged bubble-bubble drag forces ¯𝐹𝑏⁢𝑏 by assuming that ¯𝐹𝑏⁢𝑤∼𝑣2/3 and ¯𝐹𝑏⁢𝑏∼(∂𝑦𝑣)𝛽, where 𝑣 and (∂𝑦𝑣) denote average bubble velocities and gradients. This model captures the observed rate-dependent flows for 𝛽≈0.36, and the rate independent flows for 𝛽≈0.67. Third, we perform independent rheological measurements of ¯𝐹𝑏⁢𝑤 and ¯𝐹𝑏⁢𝑏, both for ordered and disordered systems, and find these to be fully consistent with the forms assumed in the simple model. Disorder thus leads to a modified effective exponent 𝛽. Fourth, we vary the packing fraction 𝜙 of the foam over a substantial range and find that the flow profiles become increasingly shear banded when the foam is made wetter. Surprisingly, the model describes flow profiles and rate dependence over the whole range of packing fractions with the same power-law exponents—only a dimensionless number 𝑘 that measures the ratio of the prefactors of the viscous drag laws is seen to vary with packing fraction. We find that 𝑘∼(𝜙−𝜙𝑐)−1, where 𝜙𝑐≈0.84 corresponds to the 2D jamming density, and suggest that this scaling follows from the geometry of the deformed facets between bubbles in contact. Overall, our work shows that the presence of disorder qualitatively changes the effective bubble-bubble drag forces and suggests a route to rationalize aspects of the ubiquitous Herschel-Bulkley (power-law) rheology observed in a wide range of disordered materials.},

Within this interpretation framework, we argue that mean-field athermal dynamics can be accounted for by the so-called Hebraud-Lequeux (HL) model, in which the mechanical noise stems explicitly from the plastic activity in the sheared medium. Then, we show that the inclusion of structural disorder, by means of a distribution of yield energy barriers, has no qualitative effect in the HL model, while such a disorder is known to be one of the key ingredients leading kinematically to a finite macroscopic yield stress in other mean-field descriptions, such as the Soft-Glassy-Rheology model.

Resetting occurs only beyond a threshold distance from the origin. This problem is motivated by physical realizations like soft matter under shear, where diffusion of a walk is induced by resetting events of other walks. We first reformulate in the broader context of diffusion with stochastic resetting the so-called Hebraud–Lequeux model for plasticity in dense soft matter, in which diffusivity is proportional to the average resetting rate. Depending on parameter values, the response to a weak external field may be either linear, or non-linear with a non-zero average position for a vanishing applied field, and the transition between these two regimes may be interpreted as a continuous phase transition. Extending the model by considering a general power-law relation between diffusivity and average resetting rate, we notably find a discontinuous phase transition between a finite diffusivity and a vanishing diffusivity in the small field limit.},

Plastic deformation is assumed to occur through series of local reorganizations. Yield stress criteria are random while each plastic slip event induces a quadrupolar long-range elastic stress redistribution. The model is discretized on a regular square lattice. Shear plasticity can be studied in this context as a depinning dynamic phase transition. We show evidence for a scale-free distribution of avalanches 𝑃⁡(𝑠)∝𝑆−𝜅 with a nontrivial exponent 𝜅≈1.25 significantly different from the mean field result 𝜅=1.5. Finite-size effects allow for a characterization of the scaling invariance of the yield stress fluctuations observed in small samples.

	abstract = {Plastic events in sheared glasses are considered an example of so-called avalanches, whose sizes obey a power-law probability distribution with the avalanche critical exponent 𝜏. Although the so-called mean-field depinning (MFD) theory predicts a universal value of this exponent, 𝜏MFD=1.5, such a simplification is now known to connote qualitative disagreement with realistic systems. Numerically and experimentally, different values of 𝜏 have been reported depending on the literature. Moreover, in the elastic regime, it has been noted that the critical exponent can be different from that in the steady state, and even criticality itself is a matter of debate. Because these confusingly varying results have been reported under different setups, our knowledge of avalanche criticality in sheared glasses is greatly limited. To gain a unified understanding, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive numerical investigation of avalanches in Lennard-Jones glasses under athermal quasistatic shear. In particular, by excluding the ambiguity and arbitrariness that has crept into the conventional measurement schemes, we achieve high-precision measurement and demonstrate that the exponent 𝜏 in the steady state follows the prediction of MFD theory, 𝜏MFD=1.5. Our results also suggest that there are two qualitatively different avalanche events. This binariness leads to the nonuniversal behavior of the avalanche size distribution and is likely to be the cause of the varying values of 𝜏 reported thus far. To investigate the dependence of criticality and universality on applied shear, we further study the statistics of avalanches in the elastic regime and the ensemble of the first avalanche event in different samples, which provide information about the unperturbed system. We show that while the unperturbed system is indeed off-critical, criticality gradually develops as shear is applied. The degree of criticality is encoded in the fractal dimension of the avalanches, which starts from zero in the off-critical unperturbed state and saturates in the steady state. Moreover, the critical exponent 𝜏 is consistent with the prediction of the MFD 𝜏MFD universally, regardless of the amount of applied shear, once the system becomes critical.},

While generic features in the flow and microscopic dynamics support the idea of a universal scaling theory of deformation, direct microscopic evidence remains poor. Here, we provide the first measurement of internal scaling relations in the deformation of granular matter. By combining macroscopic force fluctuation measurements with internal strain imaging, we demonstrate the existence of robust scaling relations from particle-scale to macroscopic flow. We identify consistent power-law relations truncated by systematic pressure-dependent cutoff, in agreement with recent mean-field theory of slip avalanches in elasto-plastic materials, revealing the existence of a mechanical critical point. These results experimentally establish scale-bridging relations in the flow of matter, paving the way to a new universal theory of deformation.},

	abstract = {Domain walls in magnets, vortex lattices in superconductors, contact lines at depinning, and many other systems can be modeled as an elastic system subject to quenched disorder. The ensuing field theory possesses a well-controlled perturbative expansion around its upper critical dimension. Contrary to standard field theory, the renormalization group (RG) flow involves a function, the disorder correlator Δ(w), and is therefore termed the functional RG. Δ(w) is a physical observable, the auto-correlation function of the center of mass of the elastic manifold. In this review, we give a pedagogical introduction into its phenomenology and techniques. This allows us to treat both equilibrium (statics), and depinning (dynamics). Building on these techniques, avalanche observables are accessible: distributions of size, duration, and velocity, as well as the spatial and temporal shape. Various equivalences between disordered elastic manifolds, and sandpile models exist: an elastic string driven at a point and the Oslo model; disordered elastic manifolds and Manna sandpiles; charge density waves and Abelian sandpiles or loop-erased random walks. Each of the mappings between these systems requires specific techniques, which we develop, including modeling of discrete stochastic systems via coarse-grained stochastic equations of motion, super-symmetry techniques, and cellular automata. Stronger than quadratic nearest-neighbor interactions lead to directed percolation, and non-linear surface growth with additional Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) terms. On the other hand, KPZ without disorder can be mapped back to disordered elastic manifolds, either on the directed polymer for its steady state, or a single particle for its decay. Other topics covered are the relation between functional RG and replica symmetry breaking, and random-field magnets. Emphasis is given to numerical and experimental tests of the theory.},

The long-ranged stress correlations can be traced to the coupling of shear stress to transverse momentum, which is ignored in the classic Maxwell model. To rescue this widely used model, we suggest a generalization in terms of a single relaxation time 𝜏 for the fast degrees of freedom only. This generalized Maxwell model implies a divergent correlation length 𝜉 ∝𝜏 as well as dynamic critical scaling and correctly accounts for the far-field stress correlations. It can be rephrased in terms of generalized hydrodynamic equations, which naturally couple stress and momentum and furthermore allow us to connect to fluidity and elastoplastic models.},

There is accumulating evidence that the yielding transition between a flowing and an arrested phase is a critical phenomenon, but the associated exponents are not understood, even at a mean-field level where the validity of popular models is debated. Here, we solve a mean-field model that captures the broad distribution of the mechanical noise generated by plasticity, whose behavior is related to biased Levy flights near an absorbing boundary. We compute the exponent θ characterizing the density of shear transformation P(x)∼xθ, where x is the stress increment beyond which they yield. We find that after an isotropic thermal quench, θ=1/2. However, θ depends continuously on the applied shear stress; this dependence is not monotonic, and its value at the yield stress is not universal. The model rationalizes previously unexplained observations and captures reasonably well the value of exponents in three dimensions. Values of exponents in four dimensions are accurately predicted. These results support the fact that it is the true mean-field model that applies in large dimensions, and they raise fundamental questions about the nature of the yielding transition.},

En premier lieu, notre travail a porte sur l'inclusion d'inhomogeneites dans le cadre de la theorie de couplage de modes appliquee à la rheologie et nous avons notamment obtenu une equation generale d'evolution des inhomogeneites de densite. À basse temperature, l'ecoulement est en effet fortement heterogène : des phases de deformation elastique sont entrecoupees de rearrangements de particules, brusques et localises, qui interagissent par le biais des deformations elastiques qu'ils genèrent. En second lieu, nous avons donc considere un modèle calque sur ce scenario et affine ses elements constitutifs pour rendre compte de la competition entre cisaillement applique et rearrangements locaux, à l'origine de la courbe d'ecoulement des materiaux athermiques.

Pour ce qui est des correlations spatiales dans l'ecoulement, nous avons montre qu'il n'existe pas de loi d'echelle universelle dans les modèles elasto-plastiques, malgre la presence d'une classe de longueurs de correlation decroissant comme dot\{gamma\}{\textasciicircum}\{ icefrac\{-1\}\{d\}\} en d dimensions, dans le regime domine par le cisaillement. Par ailleurs, dans diverses variantes du modèle, le cisaillement se trouve localise dans une region du materiau. Ce phenomène apparaît dès lors que les blocs elasto-plastiques sont durablement fragilises à la suite d'un evenement plastique. Enfin, les predictions du modèle ont ete directement mises en regard avec des experiences sur l'ecoulement en microcanal d'emulsions concentrees et des simulations de dynamique moleculaire à temperature nulle. Les ecarts observes nous ont pousse à developper et implementer un code plus flexible, qui s'appuie sur une routine simplifiee d'elements Finis et rend mieux compte du desordre structurel et des effets inertiels.},

	abstract = {Upon loading, amorphous solids can exhibit brittle yielding, with the abrupt formation of macroscopic shear bands leading to fracture, or ductile yielding, with a multitude of plastic events leading to homogeneous flow. It has been recently proposed, and subsequently questioned, that the two regimes are separated by a sharp critical point, as a function of some control parameter characterizing the intrinsic disorder strength and the degree of stability of the solid. In order to resolve this issue, we have performed extensive numerical simulations of athermally driven elastoplastic models with long-range and anisotropic realistic interaction kernels in two and three dimensions. Our results provide clear evidence for a finite-disorder critical point separating brittle and ductile yielding, and we provide an estimate of the critical exponents in 2D and 3D.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a coherent scenario of the formation of permanent shear bands in the flow of yield stress materials. It is a well accepted point of view that flow in disordered media occurs via local plastic events, corresponding to small size rearrangements, that yield a long range stress redistribution over the system. Within a minimalistic mesoscopic model that incorporates these local dynamics, we study the spatial organisation of the local plastic events. The most important parameter in this study is the typical restructuring time needed to regain the original structure after a local rearrangement. In agreement with a recent mean field study [Coussot et al., Eur. Phys. J. E, 2010, 33, 183] we observed the spontaneous formation of permanent shear bands, when this restructuring time is large compared to the typical stress release time in a rearrangement. The bands consist of a large number of plastic events within a solid region that remains elastic. This heterogeneous flow behaviour is different in nature from the transient dynamical heterogeneities that one observes in the small shear rate limit in flow without shear-banding [Martens et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2011, 106, 156001]. We analyse in detail the dependence of the shear bands on system size, shear rate and restructuring time. Further, we rationalise the scenario within a mean field version of the spatial model that produces a non monotonous flow curve for large restructuring times. This explains the instability of the homogeneous flow below a critical shear rate, that corresponds to the minimum of the curve. Our study therefore strongly supports the idea that the characteristic time scales involved in the local dynamics are at the physical origin of permanent shear bands.},

All systems belonging to a given universality class have the same critical exponents, and certain scaling functions become identical near the critical point. It is the aim of this work to demonstrate the usefulness of universal scaling functions for the analysis of non-equilibrium phase transitions. In order to limit the coverage of this article, we focus on a particular class of non-equilibrium critical phenomena, the so-called absorbing phase transitions. These phase transitions arise from a competition of opposing processes, usually creation and annihilation processes. The transition point separates an active phase and an absorbing phase in which the dynamics is frozen. A systematic analysis of universal scaling functions of absorbing phase transitions is presented, including static, dynamical, and finite-size scaling measurements. As a result a picture gallery of universal scaling functions is presented which allows to identify and to distinguish universality classes.},

	abstract = {Amorphous systems deep blow the glass transition, as well as colloidal glasses at high packing fractions,concentrated emulsions, foam systems, etc. exhibit divergent microscopic relaxation time scales and flowonly upon a large enough external loading. This dynamical phase transition of amorphous systems fromthe apparent solid state to the apparent liquid state mediated by the external loading, is called theyielding transition. This transition is studied throughout this thesis by a mesoscopic modeling approach,specifically versions of the so-called elasto-plastic model.After introducing a general background of the glass transition and experimental systems, that are thetarget of the elasto-plastic model description, a formulation of the elasto-plastic model, slightly differentfrom the conventional ones used in the literature, is introduced for incorporating both the shear ratecontrol and the stress control protocols. It is also shown that the mean-field Hebraud-Lequeux model canbe derived from the spatially resolved elasto-plastic model by assuming some approximations.Using the shear rate control protocol, the yielding transition is firstly probed by studying the shearrate dependence of the avalanche statistics close to criticality. A crossover from a non mean-field behaviorto an apparent mean-field behavior with respect to an increasing shear rate is evidenced. Scaling laws in thezero shear rate limit, support the idea that the yielding transition belongs to a non mean-field universalityclass of a dynamical phase transition. The dependence of the symmetry of the average shape of the stressdrops on the stress drop duration, the system size and the shear rate, leads to the interpretation that stressdrops at finite shear rates result from the superposition of individual avalanches possessing a cooperativelength and time scale.By studying the macroscopic stress fluctuation, the cooperative length scale l\_c is identified as thecrossover size below which the scaling relation with the system size 1/L{\textasciicircum}d implied by the central limittheorem breaks down. Further a saturation time scale T\_c can be defined in the analysis of the timeseries of macroscopic plastic strain rate. Below this time scale one observes the manifestation of Browniandynamics. The saturation time for systems of sizes smaller than the cooperative length l\_c scales withthe system size as a power law T\_c{\textasciitilde}(l\_c){\textasciicircum}z, which can be interpreted as the scaling relation between thecooperative time and the cooperative length of individual avalanches.Further using the stress controlled protocol, the yielding transition is studied by simulating typical creep experiments of the amorphous systems. The mesoscopic models (the elasto-plastic model aswell as the mean-field Hebraud-Lequeux model) are shown to be capable to reproduce the response ofthe macroscopic shear rate to an imposed stress slightly above the yielding point in qualitatively goodagreement with several experiments. Within the mesoscopic modeling approach, the results reveal thatthe creep behavior depends strongly on the initial condition of the amorphous system submitted to creepexperiments.},

Experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are hampered by limited statistical samples, and although existing stochastic models give precise exponents, they require strong assumptions about fixed deformation directions, at odds with the statistical isotropy of amorphous materials. Here, we introduce a fully tensorial, stochastic mesoscale model for amorphous plasticity that links the statistical physics of plastic yielding to engineering mechanics. It captures the complex shear patterning observed for a wide variety of deformation modes, as well as the avalanche dynamics of plastic flow. Avalanches are described by universal size exponents and scaling functions, avalanche shapes, and local stability distributions, independent of system dimensionality, boundary and loading conditions, and stress state. Our predictions consistently differ from those of mean-field depinning models, providing evidence that plastic yielding is a distinct type of critical phenomenon.},

Although such materials are ubiquitous and relevant for indus- try, there is no accepted microscopic description of how they yield, even in the simplest situations where temperature is negligible and where flow inhomogeneities such as shear bands or fractures are ab- sent. Here we propose a scaling description of the yielding transition in amorphous solids made of soft particles at zero temperature. Our description makes a connection between the Herschel-Bulkley expo- nent characterizing the singularity of the flow curve near the yield stress \{{\textbackslash}Sigma\}c, the extension and duration of the avalanches of plasticity observed at threshold, and the density P(x) of soft spots, or shear transformation zones, as a function of the stress increment x be- yond which they yield. We argue that the critical exponents of the yielding transition can be expressed in terms of three independent exponents \{{\textbackslash}theta\}, df and z, characterizing respectively the density of soft spots, the fractal dimension of the avalanches, and their duration. Our description shares some similarity with the depinning transition that occurs when an elastic manifold is driven through a random potential, but also presents some striking differences. We test our arguments in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton model similar to those used in depinning, but with a different interaction kernel, and find satisfying agreement with our predictions both in two and three dimensions.},

	abstract = {Rheology aims at quantifying the response of materials to mechanical forcing. However, standard rheometers provide only global macroscopic quantities, such as viscoelastic moduli. They fail to capture the heterogeneous flow of soft amorphous materials at the mesoscopic scale, arising from the rearrangements of the microstructural elements, that must be accounted for to build predictive models. To address this experimental challenge, we have combined shear rheometry and time-resolved X-ray micro-tomography on 3D liquid foams used as model glassy materials, yielding a unique access to the stresses and contact network topology at the bubble scale. We reveal a universal scaling behavior of the local stress build-up and relaxation associated with topological modifications. Moreover, these plastic events redistribute stress non-locally, as if the foam were an elastic medium subjected to a quadrupolar deformation. Our findings clarify how the macroscopic elastoplastic behavior of amorphous materials emerges from the spatiotemporal stress variations induced by microstructural rearrangements.},

Phys Rev Lett 95: 195501]. The good agreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions in the STZ volumes provides compelling evidence that the plastic flow of metallic glasses occurs through cooperative shearing of unstable STZs activated by shear stresses. Moreover, the ductility of BMGs was found to intrinsically correlate with their STZ volumes. The experiments presented herein pave a way to gain a quantitative insight into the atomic-scale mechanisms of BMG mechanical behavior.},

The resulting mechanical properties are close to the behavior found experimentally. At small strains, the pristine systems are akin to other glassy systems with a so-called gap distribution with a small positive exponent. Critical avalanching behavior is found only approaching the yield point. The post-yield stress drops are universal, and the gap distribution becomes flat.},

Plastic relaxation events redistribute stresses in the system in a very anisotropic way. A review is given of not only the physical insight provided by these models into practical issues such as strain localization, creep, and steady-state rheology, but also the fundamental questions that they address with respect to criticality at the yielding point and the statistics of avalanches of plastic events. Furthermore, connections are discussed with concurrent mean-field approaches and with related problems such as the plasticity of crystals and the depinning of an elastic line.},

              We analyze the behavior of different elastoplastic models approaching the yielding transition. We propose two kinds of rules for the local yielding events: yielding occurs above the local threshold either at a constant rate or with a rate that increases as the square root of the stress excess. We establish a family of “static” universal critical exponents which do not depend on this dynamic detail of the model rules: in particular, the exponents for the avalanche size distribution

We further discuss an alternative mean-field approximation to yielding only based on the so-called Hurst exponent of the accumulated mechanical noise signal, which gives good predictions for the exponents extracted from simulations of fully spatial models.},
